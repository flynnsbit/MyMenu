Open Cubic Player 2.6.0pre6
----------------------------

I have updated the DirectX sound driver system to work with DirectX 7 or later.
To use the DirectX driver you have to copy the vxdapc.vxd into your
windows\system directory and start cphost.exe . Look at the FAQ section in the
documentation, if something is not working.

If you don't know OCP yet, please have a look into the doc\ directory. Your 
questions should be answered there.

If you have any further questions ask me:
