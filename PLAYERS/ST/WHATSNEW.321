                      ---------------------------------

     Bugs fixed:

     * The 'Out of Gravis memory' message appearing whenever loading
       instruments through the instrument library has been fixed to
       appear only when appropriate.



                       What's new in Scream Tracker 3.2
                       --------------------------------

       As we promised in the last version of Scream Tracker, if enough
     bugs are found, a new version will be released. This file is a
     compilation of the bugs that were found and the features that have
     been added to ST. The fact still remains, there are no guarantees of
     a new version of Scream Tracker or any updates. Bug reports will still
     be received at edge@xgw.fi, though.
       This list of bugs is so that everyone knows what to avoid doing if
     forced to use the old ST for some reason. Also, these bugs should no
     longer be reported. The smallest bugs aren't listed here because they
     usually aren't fatal and don't affect composing in any remarkable way.

     Bugs fixed:

     * The pattern loop default loop point is now the beginning of the
       pattern, not the row the loop command is on.

     * Cutting a sample longer than 64000 bytes no longer corrupts the
       sample.

     * Approximate Length function stops the song. It used to corrupt the
       pattern data if the song was being played.

     * Loading a sample from the intrument library didn't release the
       memory, which usually ended up crashing the tracker after a while
       (a long while, that is).

     * The sample offset command didn't repeat the last value given to it.

     * The swap sample command in the instrument list increased the total
       space taken up by the patterns by about 7 kb.

     * The palette couldn't be customized. More specifically, the palette
       was reset every time ST was loaded.

     * In the polychannel mode, the editing screen didn't always follow the
       cursor.

     * When a patterndelay and a pattern break are on the same row, the delay
       comes before the break.

     * When a patternloop and a pattern break are on the same row, the loop
       comes before the break.

     * When loading a song and pressing N at the "are you sure"-prompt, the
       song filename was changed, resulting in the overwriting of the song
       which was being loaded.

     * Two SBx (x<>0) commands on the same row caused an infinite loop.

     * The "free GUS memory" field works properly.

     * Tremor with a value of 00 now repeats the value of the last row.

     * ALT+K with an area of one row doesn't crash the tracker anymore.

     Features added:

     * Flip sample command - converts an Amiga sample to a PC sample and
       vice versa. Text files have to be flipped after they are loaded into
       memory so they can be viewed.

     * Save sample without header (ALT-W) command.

     * Maximize volume now loads samples to GUS memory automatically.

     * Skip value of 0. (ALT-0)

     * A sample can now be cut at the loop end point in the instrument list.

     * Fine Vibrato command. (Four times more accurate than normal vibrato)

     * Glissando Control command.

     * Set channel panning command. (Only on a GUS!)

     * Channel default pan settings. (Only on a GUS!)

     * Channel pan position visible on infopage. (Only on a GUS!)

     * Fast volumeslides option for old ST2 and ST3 modules that were created
       with the player that used to slide the volume with the D, K and L
       commands on every frame.

     * Gravis ultraclick removal by using 16, 24 or 32 GUS channels
       (the more channels, the lower the sound quality will be in KHz,
       but the clicks will lessen considerably).

     * The position counters and Channelscope now work with GUS, too.

     * When saving a MOD, all conversion errors are shown.

     * A new "Mod Edit Mode", which turns all non-compatible pattern data
       red while editing.

     * Selectable distance between the dark grey bars in the pattern edit
       mode for writing songs in 3/4 and the like.
