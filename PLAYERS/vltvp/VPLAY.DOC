   1.Introduction
   ==============

   Here it is! A new music player hits the computer world! As if there
   weren't enough of them already, I hear you grumble...
     Yes, we know that there are alot of players out there, and some of
   them are even very good, but in fact, NONE of them handles the most
   advanced format currently available correctly. The best
   implementation that we have heard sounded terrible, so we decided to
   create a player that was able to play this marvellous format, called
   AMS, 100% perfect...And as a matter of fact, while doing this, we
   figured that we could play other formats perfectly well too, since
   the AMS format is so complex and contains everything that is
   supported by the other formats it was a piece of cake.
     So here you've got a player that is able to play your modules
   perfectly well! Supported formats are:

      AMS - Velvet Studio.
      XM  - FastTracker v2.x
      S3M - Screamtracker v3
      STM - Screamtracker v2
      MOD - Protracker/Taketracker etc etc
      ULT - Ultratracker
      MTM - Multitracker

   Those formats are the most common ones, as far as we know, and
   therefore we think it is enough to support them. Exotic formats can
   be converted to these "standards" anyway.

   VPlay supports the following soundcards:

      Soundblaster / Pro / 16 / Awe32
      Gravis Ultrasound	/ MAX / PNP

   If you're fond of fancy displays and cool graphical analyzers this is
   not a program for you. We have mainly concentrated on creating a
   player that actually plays the music correctly. From the beginning it
   was meant to be a simple commandline player, but then we thought that
   a little interface could be nice. Building it in textmode was the
   simplest thing to do. We wanted it to be a player that could be
   integrated in for example Norton Commander easily.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------

   2.Using VPlay
   =============

   Vplay is built to be as simple as possible. Currently I'm sitting
   here wondering if anyone really needs this document at all. Well, a
   program needs a documentation to be respected, doesn't it?
     Okay, I'll write some basic stuff to make it easy for you to get
   into the player...


   2.1.Playing modules
   -------------------

   VPlay is smart and will detect your soundcards for you. When you
   start it, VPlay will scan your environment variables for all kinds of
   cards, and the best one found will be chosen for playing the music.
   (If you want to override this, remove your envs...)
     To start VPlay you need to specify the modules to play on the
   commandrow. VPlay has (currently) no diskoptions inside the program.

      Examples:


      To play one single module:

         VPLAY c:\modules\jazz.ams

      This will play the AMS tune "JAZZ.AMS".


      To play several modules:

         VPLAY c:\modules\rock.mod c:\modules\other\blues.ams

      This will play the MOD "ROCK.MOD" and then the AMS tune
      "BLUES.AMS" in the "modules\other" directory.


      To play several modules using wildcards:

         VPLAY *.XM

      This will play all XM modules in the current directory.


      Combining the techniques:

         VPLAY *.MOD c:\modules\jazz.ams d:\goodluck.s3m e:\*.*

      This commandline will play all MODs in the current directory, then
      play "JAZZ.AMS" followed by "GOODLUCK.S3M" on the D: drive and end
      with playing all modules found on the E: drive.

   If VPlay finds a file that is not a supported module format, or maybe
   not a module at all, it will display an error message and proceed to
   the next tune.
     If you have some valid modules to play, you should now be able to
   enter the VPlay menus.


   2.2.Display
   -----------

   The VPlay Mainscreen is built of three blocks. The upper block
   contains playing information for the song and key commands that are
   available. The lower part is always a spectrum analyzer and the
   middle part may contain different things depending on your choice.
     Let's begin with the upper part. The upper left window contains the
   name of the song currently playing (or the filename if loading), the
   name of the composer (only used in AMS songs) and the format of the
   song. Error messages and other messages will also be displayed in
   these fields.
     Below this window there is a small, grey window containing the
   playtime and the total time. As you would expect, the playtime is the
   time that the current module has played, and the total time is how
   long you've been using VPlay. Amazing or what? :)
     To the right of the key window there is a window full of nice
   information. Position, pattern and row tells you the exact position
   currently playing in the song. The digits to the right of the slash
   ("/") tells you how many of the different things that the song or
   pattern consists of. For example, in AMS songs, the nr of rows aren't
   always 64. It can be from 1 to 255...
     Channels is the current number of channels used in the pattern. Max
   is the maximum amount of channels used on a pattern in the whole
   song. This is also AMS specific, since the amount of channels used
   may vary from pattern to pattern.
     The volume tells you the current playing volume.
     Last, but not least (hmmm...), is the PattName. This is a feature
   used in AMS, where you can give each pattern an own name.
     The keywindow will be discussed in the next section...

   The middle part of the screen may contain four different windows.
   These are:

      * Equalizer   A nice equalizer displaying hits on each channel.
                    For AMS compatibility, channel names are also
                    displayed on each side of the equalizers.
      * Instruments Displays all instruments used in the song. When an
                    instrument is used, a little led will indicate that
                    the instrument is triggered. If more than 32
                    instruments is used you can scroll up and down in
                    the list by using cursor up/down.
      * Description The AMS has a nice possibility to add entire texts
                    describing your music piece, instead of destroying
                    all your samplenames. This window displays the
                    description text for a module. If there is more text
                    than the window can display, use cursor keys to
                    scroll.
      * Config      This window is used for configurating VPlay.


   The lower part of the mainscreen always contains a spectrum analyzer.
   Unfortunately it's not a real FFT analyzer. It just reacts when notes
   a triggered on a channel.


   2.3.Keys
   --------

   In the upper part of the VPlay Mainscreen you can see a small window
   describing all available key commands. This is a more verbose
   explanation of them...

                 C : Bring up the Config window. Read more in the
                     configuration section (2.4).
		 D : Bring up the Description window. Read more in the
                     Display section (2.2).
		 E : Bring up the Equalizer window. Read more in the
                     Display section (2.2).
		 I : Bring up the Instrument window. Read more in the
                     Display section (2.2).
	       ESC : Used for quitting VPlay. Depending on your
                     configuration settings VPlay will or will not fade
                     out music/graphics in a nice way.
	       Del : By pressing the Del key you can delete a song from
                     disk. This is very useful if you've just got a lot
                     of new modules from a friend and you want to erase
                     some of them and just keep the good ones. Just make
                     VPlay play all of them, and when you hear a bad
                     module, just press Del. You will of course be
                     prompted before if you really want to delete the
                     module. Just press Y or N to answer the requester.
      Cursor right : By pressing cursor key right you will fast forward
                     the module. For each press you will skip to the
                     next position in the song.
       Cursor left : Opposite to the above. Rewinds the module.
	  Keypad + : Used to increase the master volume. This is useful
                     if you use headphones without adjustable volume.
	  Keypad - : Opposite to the above. Decreases the master volume.
		 N : Normally VPlay will automatically load the next
                     module when the current is finished, but if you
                     want to load the next one immediately you can press
                     this key.
	     Space : Use this to pause the module. When paused, you can
                     resume playing with this key too.
		 J : This key command will drop you out in a dosshell.
                     The music will continue playing, but the automatic
                     loading of the next module won't work.
		 M : This key is only valid in reduced mode. It will
                     bring up the mainscreen. Read more about the
                     reduced mode in the config section (2.4).

   Cursor keys up and down are used in the Instrument window if there
   are more instruments that aren't displayed (indicated by a plus in
   the right corner). They are also used in the same way for the
   description window, if there is more text outside the window (also
   indicated by a plus.) In the config window, you use the cursor keys
   to move to the wanted option, and then you use Return to toggle the
   options. (I know that I may seem silly to set the default
   mastervolume with Return but you know, lazy programmers...)


   2.4.Configuration
   -----------------

   The configuration window is a nice piece of textmode graphics...Here
   is an explanation of all the options available:

      * Auto Load next module

	If you for some reason don't like that VPlay automatically loads
        the next module when the current is finished, you can disable it
        with this option. Modules will loop (or stop depending on the
        end of the module) eternally until you exit VPlay or manually
        choses to load next song.


      * Exit after last module

	When VPlay notices that there is nothing more to play it will
        exit if you turn this on. Otherwise it will keep playing the
        last module endlessly.


      * Reduced mode

	If you don't like the graphical interface that VPlay offers you,
        maybe you are more comfortable with this reduced mode. It
        enables you to uses VPlay as if it was a commandline player with
        no interface at all. The mainscreen will not appear when you
        start VPlay. Only some brief text will be written to the normal
        DOS screen, telling you what module that is currently playing.
        All key commands are still available (although you won't see
        anything) like ffw and rewind. If you want to display the main
        screen you can press M. By using this in combination with the
        dosshell you get a powerful musicplayer to be used when working
        in an dos environment.


      * Default middle screen

	This is a matter of taste. Some like the equalizers, some prefer
        to watch the instruments. By setting this default choice, you
        can have your favourite displayed right when you start up VPlay.
        It's like a dream :)


      * Default mastervolume

	For the headphone guys...If you cannot adjust the volume of your
        receiver, this may come in handy. Set the volume to the desired
        default level and you will avoid ear damage caused by too loud
        volume in your phones...Increase the value by pressing return.
        Silly? Yes, I know :)


      * Exit in 50 line mode

	Although I can't understand that people want to work in other
        dos modes than 80*50 or higher, I added this because I guess
        somebody will use it. If you disable this, VPlay will exit in
        80*25 mode.


      * Fade in when starting

	If this is enabled VPlay will fade up the program menus when
        entering the program from DOS.


      * Fade out when exiting

	Fades out the palette and the music before exiting VPlay. Gives
        the program a nicer touch, but some prefer faster access, so you
        can disable it if you want.


   Yes, that's all options. By pressing S you can save the config to
   disk. It will be saved in the same directory as the exe file is
   placed. If you want the default values back, just delete the config
   file called VPLAY.CFG and the default options will be used.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------

   3.Known Bugs
   ============

   VPlay has been thouroughly tested during many intensive hours. We
   believe that we have found and eliminated all serious bugs, and that
   the player should run without any problems on most configurations.
   However there may still be bugs that we have missed, and by reporting
   them to us you do us a great favour. Please get in touch with us! The
   address is listed at the end of this document.

   We are aware that this program may experience problems if run under
   Windows 3.11 or earlier. It is entirely designed to be run under DOS.
   But if you use OS/2 or Win95 there should not be any problems. We
   have not extensively tested this yet, but it looks okay.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------

   4.Information
   =============

   The VPlay interface is entirely coded in 100% Assembler by Pontus
   Munck (aka Vicious/Velvet) during a period about two weeks, from the
   end of February 1996 to the beginning of March 1996.
     The player code, which is the main stone of the product, is
   directly imported from our musicprogram Velvet Studio. It is coded
   100% in Assembler by Patrik Oscarsson (aka Baldric/Velvet) during a
   much longer period, from the start of 1992 until now. The first
   versions of the player (back in 1992) was however not very good, but
   still it could play 4-channel MODs supporting most of the commands,
   and that was impressive back then. I guess this has developed a bit
   since then, and also expanded to an entire music program.
