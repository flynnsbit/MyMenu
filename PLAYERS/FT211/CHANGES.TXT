Changes in v2.10:
  - Removed broken GUS InterWave support, fixes GUS problems.
  - Scrollbars are now less frustrating to use.
  - Waveform polarity was wrong on scopes and in Smp. Ed.
  - Max audio mixing rate was changed from 44000 to 44100.
  - Channel numbers now start at 1 instead of 0.
  - WAV loader has been improved and now supports weird files.
  - Sample rate tuning (WAV playback freq.) when loading .wav.
  - Changed default sample test play note from C-5 to C-4.
  - Right mouse button = clear pattern mark.
  - The scopes now show their number even while muted.
  - Updated (and corrected some parts of) the help text.

  - Bugfixes to prevent crashes:
    * "Cut Pattern" on pattern lengths of 256/$100 (v2.09)
    * "Morph Sample" could crash FT2 in some cases
    * Editing empty patterns with lengths above 204/$0CC
    * Using XM effect E7x (x >= 4) would freeze FT2 on notes

  - General bugfixes:
    * Improper Bxx (position jump) use would mess up the GUI
    * Disk Op: .wav files were accidentally listed in module mode
    * WAV loader now safely rejects non-supported files
    * Properly clamp instrument data on load (prevent GUI mess)
    * "Save Range" didn't support .wav mode
    * Replen should never be set to below 2 when saving as .mod
    * Use register $41 instead of $42 to set output rate on SB16
    * You can now rename FT2.EXE and it will still run properly
    * Fixed bugs with keyboard pattern marking
    * Pattern mark. wasn't clamped when adding/removing chans
    * "Song repeat start" is now cleared during song zapping
    * Nibbles grid was wrongly rendered

Changes in v2.10a:
  - Two small general bugs fixed.
  - List WAV files in module mode again (I see why now).
  - Reject loading of WAV files in module mode.
  - Refresh the Disk Op. directory after writing song to WAV.
  - Fixed some critical bugs with save/load on track/pattern.

Changes in v2.10b:
  - SB/SB Pro: Fixed an error in audio rate calculation on
    some rates (f.ex. 22050Hz stereo or 44100Hz mono).
  - Changed some of the default audio settings.

Changes in v2.10c:
  - .MOD/.S3M/.STM import is now improved and bugfixed.
  - Improved and bugfixed the .MOD saver.
  - Fixed a really old bug with uninitialized values in the sample
    headers while saving .XMs.
  - Fixed sample rates being slighly off when importing .STMs.
  - Added some missing keybindings to the help text.
  - Removed some unneeded code.
  - Removed unused graphics, making the .EXE almost 100kB
    smaller.

Changes in v2.11:
  - Fixed a bug from FT2.10c where setting a sample's loop to
    "pingpong" would crash the program if "Replen." was zero.
  - XFade didn't work correctly on 16-bit pingpong samples and
    could crash the program.
  - Stereo samples from loaded XMs/XIs will no longer be
    unplayable (but will still only contain the left channel data).
  - .MOD/.S3M/.STM import is yet again improved and bugfixed.
    Certain 15-sample MOD files may still load incorrectly though.
  - Prevent system lock-up when loading very specific S3M files.
  - Up/down pushbutton delay has been increased to prevent
    accidentally skipping too much.
  - Fixed a bug with the sampling position line (Smp. Ed.) after a
    non-looping sample has been played.
  - Inserting a key-off in edit mode where "Add." is 0 would
    cause it to not be displayed until you move the row up/down.
  - 44100Hz is now the default mixing frequency.
  - The default amp is now 10x (doesn't affect GUS).
  - SB16: Setting the mixing frequency to 44100Hz now gives a
    true frequency of 45454Hz instead of 41666Hz.
  - SB Pro/SB16: Added a config switch to not allow FT2 to
    modify the SB mixer volumes. Handy for laptops with digital
    volume controls, where FT2 would reset vol. to 100% at times.
  - More small changes not worth of a mention.
