DAMP - The DOS MP3 Player and Visualisation Program
By Matt Craven
Using Ove Kaaven's LibAMP library.

=========================== CHANGE LOG ==================================

Version 0.96
============
- Compiled with latest WIP of Allegro.
- ID3 Genre support.
- Added damp_id3_genre to damplcd.sh
- Added damp_shared_int, damp_shared_char[1024], and
  damp_shared_float to dampcore.sh, in case you want to pass information
  between input and output drivers...
- Fixed the time display when in graphics mode (thanks to Michael for
  spotting that bug!)
- More joystick support: DB9 on LPT ports, TurboGrafx on LPT ports, and
  IFSega ISA or PCI
- Added display_lines to the [lcd] section of DAMP.ini, and
  lcd_display_lines for LCD drivers to use (none of the current drivers
  make use of this setting as of 9th April 2000)

Version 0.95 WIP 9
==================
- New gfx modifiers: pearlglass, tristar, spikes, waterfall, wavyzoom,
  ripple, warp, sucker.
- Made gf_blur_heavy the default graphics filter.
- New gfx waveform: blobs
- Added volume_fine to the [joystick_control] section of DAMP.ini
- Should now support playback of .MP2 files directly (ie you don't need
  to rename them to .mp3), but this is untested.
- Added PREVIOUS_N_TRACKS and NEXT_N_TRACKS to the joystick controls, so
  a joystick can be used to skip several tracks at once.
- Added -sleep <n> option which quits DAMP after <n> minutes. If you set
  the "sleep_fade" option to "yes" in DAMP.ini, then it will also fade
  out.
- A few little changes to readme.txt - general bits n pieces. I'd recommend
  that anyone who hasn't read the readme for several releases should
  probably do so.

Version 0.95 WIP 8
==================
- Added the abiltity to skip forwards and backwards several tracks at
  once using the cursor right/left keys. The number of tracks skipped
  is determined by the "large_skip" setting in DAMP.INI
- Can now also use the backspace key to skip to previous track. (Just to
  fit in with using ENTER to go forward a track).
- Can now toggle "time remaining" display on and off by pressing V
- Exported util_time_remain_toggle() for input drivers to use.
- "Time Remaining" is now more accurate and should be correct for all
  formats of MP3.
- Time display now updates properly when rewinding with "time remaining"
  enabled.
- New option in DAMP.ini for LCD displays: display_width  - now you can
  customize the display width and get a nice output on your 40x2 LCD :-)
  I've had to update all the drivers, so if you're using a driver downloaded
  from the DAMP web site, you'll have to download it again.
- New variable for LCD drivers to use: lcd_display_width contains the width
  as specified in DAMP.ini - I've already altered the existing drivers to
  use this, but anyone currently writing a driver should look at LCDWIRE1.SC
  to see how it's done (basically change "16" to "lcd_display_width")
- LCD now has a symbol to show whether continuous play is enabled or not.
  I've set this to "C" by default, but LCD drivers are free to change it
  (the variable is lcd_continuous_symbol).
- Can now press F1 (if not in gfx mode or GUI) to show a DAMP help page
  which gives a summary of the keys.
- You can now see the playlist in the GUI, although all you can do with it
  at the moment is scroll up and down it...
- 3 new modifers for gfx mode: spiral_left, spiral_right, sincos.

Version 0.95 WIP 7
==================
- Added the -skip <n> option to skip the first <n> tracks. Eg -skip 2
  will skip the first two tracks and start playing at track 3.
- Changed the sb_* settings in DAMP.INI to sound_* as they work for other
  cards, not just SoundBlasters.
- If it hangs but you can still press ENTER to skip through tracks, set
  the port,irq and dma settings in the [sound] section of DAMP.INI to
  values that match those of your sound card, and see if that helps.
- If a playlist entry is in fact another playlist, then that playlist
  will also be played by DAMP.  You can therefore create a hierarchy of
  playlists within playlists...
- Added the [graphics] section which allows you to specify a filter that
  gets applied to the graphics. So you're no longer stuck with the same
  blur effect - you can make your own!
- Screen resolution when using the GUI is now configureable via the [gui]
  section of DAMP.INI
- Colours of the GUI are configureable via DAMP.INI
- Minor change to the licence, re: Commercial Use.
- Added the -remaining option, which makes DAMP display track time remaining
  instead of time elapsed. NOTE: I haven't tested this on anything other
  than 16-bit 128Kbps stereo MP3s - it could be wrong on files encoded
  differently.
- Added the ability to toggle continuous play on and off by pressing C.
- Added the ability to toggle sync to beats on and off by pressing B.
- Made "beautify filenames" make all words start with uppercase and
  continue in lowercase (eg THIS becomes This).
- Added damp_time_remaining for LCD drivers to use.
- Added util_contiuous_toggle() and util_sync_toggle() for input drivers
  to use.

Version 0.95 WIP 6
==================
- Fixed a bug that caused DAMP to crash under plain DOS
- It may now hang under DOS when it starts to play - although I cannot
  verify that this isn't just something to do with my system setup -
  so I'd like people to report their experiences of running DAMP under
  DOS (either let me know it works, or tell me it hangs).

Version 0.95 WIP 5
==================
- Fixed a bug that stopped the numeric keypad from working.
- Fixed a bug that stopped LCD drivers working.
- Fixed a bug that could stop the GUI working.
- Fixed GUI window titles (removed the ^ character off the end of them)
- Added the -paused option and start_paused ini setting, so you can
  start DAMP in pause mode.
- Added the damp_playlist_filename and damp_playlist_filename_short for
  LCD drivers to use.

Version 0.95 WIP 4
==================
- Added the ffwd_rew_speed and vol_up_down_speed settings to DAMP.ini
- Added the startup_mp3 setting to DAMP.ini
- Added the SPHERE gfx modifier (like fisheye, but more spherical).
- Added the CONCENTRIC gfx waveform (draws concentric circles).
- Added the ROTATE_LEFT and ROTATE_RIGHT modifiers, as well as
  ROTATE_LEFT_ZOOM and ROTATE_RIGHT_ZOOM, which zoom in as well as
  rotating.
- Joysticks now calibrate before use. NOTE: Calibration instructions
  are printed to the DOS prompt, so if you're using DAMP without a
  monitor, I suggest you plug a monitor in, calibrate, and check
  it works before going back to a monitor-less setup.
  Also note, set your joystick type using the "type" setting in the
  [joystick] section of DAMP.ini BEFORE calibrating.
- Support for Gravis GrIP, Playstation pads, N64 pads, and the
  Wingman Warrior joystick.
- Possibly supports Soundblaster Live and other poor SB clones now,
  (ones that used to get static) but this is untested.
- Possibly supports WSS (Windows Sound System) cards, but this is untested.
- Added the EXIT_CODE_* joystick actions for frontend authors (though
  this is untested).

Version 0.95 WIP 3
==================
- Added the damp_track_number and damp_selection_buffer variables for
  LCD drivers to use.
- DAMP now outputs the current track number along with the track title.
- Joystick can now control the random toggle.
- A "controls" window is now present in the gui.
- Removed common things from damplcd.sh and put them in dampcore.sh
  ready for input drivers.  damplcd.sh now #include's dampcore.sh, so
  existing LCD drivers still function correctly.
- Input driver system is now in and ready for people to write drivers.

Version 0.95 WIP 2
==================
- Added the -fnfnoquit option.
- Added the following variables to the LCD driver (LCD display customisation
  is now possible!):
  damp_random_play, damp_surround, damp_paused, damp_volume,
  damp_status, damp_filename, damp_id3_title, damp_id3_artist,
  damp_id3_album, damp_id3_year, damp_id3_comment, damp_time
  Also added the strcmp() function.
- Updated lcddrv.txt with more info on the bioscom() function.
- When selecting a track or playlist with the keypad whilst in text mode,
  the number is displayed alongside the vu-meter.
- Fixed a problem with DAMP not reading the ini file.
- Preliminary gui (enabled with -gui option or use_gui=yes in DAMP.ini).
- Added posterize_graphics setting to DAMP.ini
- Added the keypad_timeout setting to DAMP.ini
- Pressing your "next track" key/button whilst numbers are in the track
  selection buffer causes it to skip to that track/playlist immediately.
- Pressing your "previous track" key/button whilst numbers are in the
  track selection buffer causes it to cancel your selection.

Version 0.95 WIP 1
==================
- Added the "beautify_filenames" and "show_file_info" options to DAMP.ini
- Added the -beep option
- Exported the "damp_vu" variable for use in LCD drivers.
- Updated lcddrv.txt slightly.
- Support for second joystick (with 2 buttons)

Version 0.94 (Fourth Public Release)
============
- LCD driver system in and working.
- DAMP now hides the cursor in text-mode (to stop it flickering whilst
  drawing the vu-meter).
- Added the bioscom() function to the available LCD driver functions,
  which should make it possible to write a driver for a serial-port
  LCD display.

Version 0.93
============
- Totally re-wrote the LCD driver system, using C scripts rather than
  the values stored in the ini file.
- Added a "Getting the best sound quality" section to the readme.
- Removed the possibility of LCD driver support causing sound stuttering.
- Improved keyboard/joystick response time whilst LCD is in use.

Version 0.92
============
- More enhancements to "sync-to-beats".
- Can now configure the character used when displaying the text-mode
  vu-meter via an option in DAMP.ini
- Fixed the problem with rewind and fast-forward getting slower the further
  into a song you were.
- Klaus Peichl spotted the error in my LCD driver. This is now fixed and
  we're back to driver-based LCD support again.
- Added the AND and OR commands to the lcd driver, to hopefully add support
  for different wiring schemes.

Version 0.91 (23rd private beta)
============
- The driver-based LCD system didn't work, so the old method is back in.
  Looks like I'll just have to assume most LCDs are compatible, but add
  support for different wiring schemes instead.

Version 0.90 (22nd private beta)
============
- LCD support now uses a driver-based system, so it could be possible
  to support other types of LCD display. See lcddrv.txt for details
  on how to write a driver.
- Improved the textmode vu-meter and sync-to-beats method. (Thanks to
  Klaus Peichl).

Version 0.89 (21st private beta)
============
- Stopped track title from fading in gfx mode during rewind/ffwd.
- Hopefully fixed the time-display LCD bug.
- Added "Help with DAMP.ini" to readme.txt
- Added support for more joystick functionality (up to 8 buttons!).
- Added the [joystick] section to DAMP.ini so you can select exactly
  which joystick driver to use.

Version 0.88 (20th private beta)
============
- Stopped LCD from flickering.
- Fixed bug where DAMP would crash when you pressed ENTER during the
  last track.

Version 0.87 (19th private beta)
============
- More tweaks to LCD code, plus configureable scroll speed in DAMP.ini
- Ability to display track time when in graphics mode, via an option
  in DAMP.ini
- AMMENDED THE LICENCE AGREEMENT to include the following:
    "If you want to use DAMP in a commercial product, (something you make
    money out of), you MUST contact me first at damp@craven4.freeserve.co.uk
    to arrange a commercial licence."

Version 0.86 (18th private beta)
============
- Experimental support for parallel port LCD display (use the -lcd option
  to enable it).
- Fix bug when using -q 0 which would cause DAMP not to auto-continue
  to the next track.

Version 0.85 (17th private beta)
============
- Added rewind and fast-forward functions using the "[" and "]" keys (and
  of course assignable to joystick control).
- Added -beatsync option to let the user specify a beat-sensitivity
  threshold.

Version 0.84 (Third Public Beta)
============
- Minor changes.
- User-configureable visualisation options.

Version 0.83 (16th private beta)
============
- More developer output when processing command line options.
- Added -keypadhack option to attempt to overcome keypad troubles.

Version 0.82 (15th private beta)
============
- Fixed problem where DAMP always looked for DAMP.ini in the directory
  it was run from, rather than the directory where it lives.
- Fixed (hopefully) problem of looping sound between tracks when playing
  from a slower device such as a CD-R.
- Made developer mode also output sound driver description.

Version 0.81 (14th private beta)
============
- Can save screenshots by pressing TAB.
- Added -surround option and surround_sound setting in DAMP.ini to let
  you enable surround sound by default.

Version 0.80 (13th private beta)
============
- Added -noscope option to disable text-mode volume meter.
- Added more developer output to keypad track selection.

Version 0.79 (12th private beta)
============
- Multiple playlist support with previous/next playlist keys (z
  and x), and playlist selection using CTRL+Numpad, and of course
  user-defineable joystick control for previous/next playlist.
- Ability to disable id3 tag support with -noid3 option, in case it
  causes DAMP not to work in some cases.
- Playlist filename no longer needs to be the first item on the command
  line.
- Can now use a mix of MP3 filenames and playlist filenames on the
  command line (it plays the MP3s first, then the playlists).
- Fixed a small memory leak.
- Random playlist order added with -rp or -randomplaylists option,
  or through the random_playlists option in DAMP.ini

Version 0.78 (11th private beta)
============
- Preliminary, experimental support for ID3 tags.  If the MP3 has a tag,
  it will be displayed. So this feature is no use in a graphics mode.
  There may be some problems with it.
  It doesn't output "track" or "genre" yet either...
- Uses the ID3 artist/title info for scrolling across in graphics mode.
- Broke the code up a lot more to ease maintenace/enhancement of DAMP.
- Added user-defineable joystick controls (suggested by Heiko Valnion)

Version 0.77 (Second Public Beta)
============
- Minor documentation alterations.

Version 0.76 (10th private beta)
============
- Added digital joystick functionality (suggested by Joe Rybacek)

Version 0.75 (9th private beta)
============
- Attempted to speed up loading of *.mp3 under plain DOS.
- You can "fix" the bug of MP3s playing too fast on some machines
  by altering the "sb_freq" parameter in DAMP.ini

Version 0.74 (8th private beta)
============
- Fixed crashes (I hope) when running under plain DOS
  (ie not under Windows).

Version 0.73 (7th private beta)
============
- Made skip to previous and skip to next work properly on
  playlists (spotted by Jerod).
- Added the -c option to enable continuous (looped) playback.

Version 0.72 (6th private beta)
============

- Added [sound] section to DAMP.ini, which allows you to set the
  sound options for DAMP. The most important option is the
  "quality" setting, which if set to 2 will interpolate the
  sample output, giving far superior sound quality than previous
  versions of DAMP.
- Improved the keypad functionality based on suggestions by Jerod.

Version 0.71
============
- Implemented DAMP.ini
  DAMP will now read options from DAMP.ini, so you don't need to
  type them on the command line every time (but you still can
  if you want to!) Command line options override ini options.
- Fixed (again) the bug where DAMP would report that none of the playlist
  entries existed when the playlist contained no drive/path info.
- Added keypad functionality, at the request of Jerod.

Version 0.7 (Fifth private beta)
===========
- Added developer mode.
- Added a bit more checking to help stop things going wrong.
- Fixed a bug where DAMP would report that none of the playlist
  entries existed when the playlist contained no drive/path info.
- Made the "sync to beats" method more accurate.
- Added a -q 0 option to guarantee best sound quality, and to try
  and combat problems where MP3s would play too fast. This option
  will degrade visual output quality considerably.
- The -t option is now deprecated, use -s <threshold value> instead,
  or -s followed by no value to use default threshold.
- Fixed a potential problem with options requiring a value being the
  last option on the command line and not having a value.

Version 0.6 (First public beta)
===========
Changes since v0.5:
- The -t option works again. From 0 (low sensitivity) to 10 (high
  sensitivity). The default is 5.
- Documented the -v option.
- Added the ability to display the track title by pressing T
- Fixed the pause function to actually pause (and fade out the
  graphics if necessary).

Version 0.5 (Fourth private beta)
===========
Changes since v0.4:
- Can give it multiple MP3 filenames, anywhere on the command
  line, even with options in between them!
  (eg: damp.exe -r blah.mp3 -q 1 fred.mp3 -g -s cool.mp3)
  (NB: if using a playlist, it MUST be the first argument).
- Can use wildcards like: damp.exe c:\tunes\*.mp3
- Can use +/- to alter volume
- Now quits if the specified file doesn't exist
- If using playlists, it skips non-existent files (and even tells
  you how many were missing)
- Added support for "Sonique" playlists (.PLS files) - though this has
  not been extensively tested
- Changed the sync to beats method to do away with all the thresholding
  nonsense and use differencing instead. I've left the old code in, just
  in case I decide this version isn't better (but I think it probably
  is). Note this will make the -t option defunct. Or more likely I'll use
  it to allow a user-defineable "sensitivity threshold".
- Added "Surround Sound". Press S to turn on and off.
- Added multiple zoom styles
- Added -z option, to turn off zoom style changing when sync to beats is on

Version 0.4 (Third private beta)
===========
Changes since v0.3:
- Added -t option.
- Added parameter to the -n option.
- Added graphics toggle button.
- Added -m option.

Version 0.3 (Second private beta)
===========
Changes since v0.2:
- Improved sync to beats auto threshold.
- Added -n option
- Can press P to pause a track. This doesn't stop the audio output
  though, so you'll hear the current bit looping over and over, so I'm
  not sure whether pause is a good idea or not...
- Modified the playback call again, this time making the "jerkiness"
  a bit worse, but improving the sync to beats and playback quality.
- Modified palette generation to create a better visual effect.
- Added the -q option, so no jerkiness+good sound is possible! :)
- Modified the playlist reader to ignore files which don't have
  an MP3 extension (to stop it trying to play WAVs, MODs etc).
  (This wasn't actually happening under older versions).
- Fixed a problem where sync to beats would take ages to kick in
  if playing a quiet track after a loud one.
- Added the -bnw option.
- Added the verbose command line options.
- Added another waveform.

Version 0.2 (First private beta)
===========
Changes since v0.1:
- Added a version number :)
- Used a blurring rather than a fading in the graphics routine. This
  looks much nicer!
- Made the rendering smoother by calling poll_amp() in an interrupt
  than letting run_amp() do the work.
- Made "sync to beats" not quite work as well as it used to :(
- Tidied up and commented the code thoroughly.

Version 0.1
===========
- It plays MP3 files.
- Basic graphics with simple synchronisation.
