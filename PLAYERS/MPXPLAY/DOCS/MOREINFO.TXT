MPXPLAY Audio Player v1.53 by PDSoft

If You find a bug, first read the 'known bugs' section below, 
if the bug isn't there, please write it to me with these informations:
-your hardware (CPU,RAM,Soundcard)
-your operating system (DOS,Win95/98)
-your command line options (i.e. mpxplay.exe -bp -cf playlist.m3u)
-description (what did you do, and what did the program do, when you found it)
 (i.e. keyboard operations)

I never can test the program totally. Sometimes a modification causes a new bug.
If a function doesn't work properly (but it worked in the previous version(s)),
please write it to me...

Known bugs and limits:
- see FAQ.TXT for extender (DOS32A,DOS4G,PMODEW) bugs & limits
- multichannel playing (ie:5.1) is supported at AAC,AC3,DTS only (downmixed to stereo) (others decode mono/stereo only)
- AAC :
 - time-length,bitrate,seeking-bar and some time-pos related functions (crossfade,soundlimit) 
   are not correct at RAW and ADTS fileformats (but good at ADIF)
   (the program doesn't (cannot) calculate correctly the time-length of the file)
 - slow seeking in some cases (1st far forward jump)(slower at RAW and ADIF)
- MPC : 
 - only Streamversion 7.0 and 7.1 are implemented/supported
 - seeking problems(?)(sometimes the seeking can fail, and the playing stops or skips to the next song)
- CDW : 
 - doesn't work on every CD-ROMs (only on those, which can ripp (grab) audio tracks)
 - the door open/close also doesn't work on every drives
 - maybe doesn't work under WIN95/98 (hardware dependant?)(it works with my DVD players (TEAC,Toshiba))
 - problems with mixed mode CDs (data+audio)
- mixer:
 - soundlimit (-sl) doesn't work with -bp at the begin of files (only at the end of files)
- tone control (bass,treble): 
 - software based works on MP3/MP2/MPC files only (tone control doesn't work at other filetypes)
 - hardware based works on some SB16 and AWE64 cards only
- soundcard routines:
 - if you play 48khz files with original SB16 card (which cannot play 48k) use '-of 44100' option
 - maybe the soundcard IRQ works below 8 only (3-7) (set the IRQ to 5, then it will work)
 - Win9x : only SB16, SBpro and GUS work in background (because they use IRQ)(other cards work in active window only)
- crossfade: 
 - doesn't work between files with different freqency (i.e.: 22khz->44khz)
 - doesn't work at CUE (indexed files) and demo-mode (hi-scan)
 - doesn't work at fullbuffer (-bl) or at large prebuffer (-bbn 500), at auto-pause (-pap/ctrl-p) and pause-next (ctrl-s) functions
 - increased volume + limiter = non-linear fade-out and fade-in
- Win9x:
 - lfn getcwd function (int21h,ax=7147) doesn't work properly -> causes bugs in directory browser (it's good with DOSLFN)
 - possible dir-scan problems on substed drives (directory browser and -ds)
- CUE: 
 - songpos restore doesn't work properly in some cases (if freq of song is out of 32k-48k range)
 - doesn't work properly with -bl (it always loads the whole file)
- reload playlist (ctrl-r) after directory change (program doesn't save the path of playlist)
- possible bugs at random mode (random + skip-back + crossfade : skips 2 songs back)
- possible timing problems using -bn8 (mouse,joy,?)
- seeking is not exact on some VBR filetypes (MP3,OGG) and may be buggy on older APE files (v<=3.92)
- FILE: Mpxplay cannot play very short files in some cases (shorter than 0.5 sec)
- the spectrum analiser works properly on 44khz/stereo files only
- CMOS startup: only the song (playlist entry) number and the file position (%) are saved/restored
- -io + -pss (or CMOS startup) + -ipl/-idl together don't work properly
- -io doesn't work at -is

- MP2 : program doesn't support MPEG 2.0 and 2.5 (16,22,24,8,11,12khz) in Audio MPEG Layer II
- the SBpro compatible cards: 
   - sound with 8 bits & 22khz only (bad quality)
   - use more CPU (freq conversion 44->22khz)
- maximum number of playlist entries is (configurable by MaxFilenames in mpxplay.ini):
  in normal mode: 1999 (left side,directory browser), 9999 (right side,playlist)
  in doombox mode: 9999 (left side/playlist), 1999 (right side/doombox queue)
  (max. playlist size: 64*9999 = 640 kbyte)
- mpxplay.ini : max filesize=256kbytes; max number of lines=768; 
  max chars per line=352 (this may cause bugs (at sublist save/restore))
- CMOS can store only 8 (0-7) playlist numbers (at [fastlists] + -pslf)
  and 16383 playlist entries (songs), so it will not work properly if you increase
  the MaxFilenames in mpxplay.ini

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Other informations:

-PLAYLIST usage:
 -you can create a playlist:
  - under DOS with the  DIR /B/ON *.MP3 > PLAYLIST.M3U  command
  - with Mpxplay: MPXPLAY.EXE d:\*.*\*.* -@s playlist.m3u
              or: MPXPLAY.EXE -ds c -@s playlist.m3u
              or: MPXPLAY.EXE -ds c -@s playlist.m3u *.mp3

 -EXTENDED PLAYLIST (faster file info loading -> program starts playing faster):

  -create: MPXPLAY.EXE -@sx EXTLIST.MXU PLAYLIST.M3U
       or: MPXPLAY.EXE -@sx EXTLIST.MXU d:\*.*\*.*

  -use (load): MPXPLAY.EXE EXTLIST.MXU
           or: MPXPLAY.EXE -ig EXTLIST.MXU d:\*.*\*.*
           or: MPXPLAY.EXE -ig EXTLIST.MXU  (without input file(s) -> for faster directory browsing)

  - You can use sub-list(s) in extended playlist on this way:
    (you have to write these lines manually into the mxu list)
    ('°' '±' '²'chars are ascii 176,177,178)
   -M3U sub-list:
     D:\AUDIOMP3\PLAYLIST.M3U°±[sub-list]²00000000
   -MXU sub-list:
     D:\AUDIOMP3\PLAYLIST.MXU°±[sub-list]²00000000

-ID3-TAG write/update in AAC/AC3/APE/MPC (APEv2-tag) and MP3/MP2 (ID3v1.1):
  
 -you can use -iw with -it options (-ita,-itt, etc.) (see readme.txt)

 -or you can use a -il listfile on this way:

  make a text file in this form (write artist:title after every filenames)(don't write spaces in the filenames):

  filenam1.MP3 artist1:title1
  filenam2.MP3 artist2:title2
  filenam3.MP3 artist3:title3

  Name it to !FILES and run my program with these options:

  MPXPLAY.EXE -iw -il !FILES playlist.m3u
  or
  MPXPLAY.EXE -iw -il !FILES *.*

  and the program will write this ID3 info(s) into the audio files.

  (the listfile (!FILES) is same like an m3u file, but with artist & title)

 examples:
 mpxplay.exe -iw -il !FILES -itl "80's collection" -itc "encoded by myself" playlist.m3u   (you can use -il and -it options together)
 mpxplay.exe -iw -ita "Name of the artist" -ity "2004" *.mp3              (modify/write artist and year tags in all MP3 files)
 mpxplay.exe -iw -itl "New album name" -itc "" track04.ape track11.ape   (modify the album and clear the comment in the track04.ape and track11.ape files)


-FRAMES: Mpxplay handles the files in frames. 1 frame is usually 4608 pcm bytes (1152*channels*2)
	 (1 sec = ca. 38 frames)(depends on the freq of file too)

-CD-WAV (CDW) : the cd-wav function is not a simple audio CD player, this is
 a real time Digital Audio Copy (it reads the cda sectors and writes them to
 the sound card), because of this you can use crossfade, speed control,
 auto volume correction and surround on audio CDs! (recommended to use -bp)

-USING MPXPLAY 
 - WITHOUT HARDDISK: I haven't tested it, try -db option
 - WITHOUT VGA CARD: I also haven't tested it, try -f0 option

-LESS CPU USAGE: the program uses less cpu time without spectrum analiser,
 volume correction, surround, soundlimit and volume meter.
 Use this for slow CPUs: mpxplay.exe -sl 0 -ddma -f0 -v -bl -bn8 playlist.m3u
 OR: mpxplay.exe -sl 0 -ddma -bl -bn8 playlist.m3u
  and set in mpxplay.ini: Displaymode=76 or Displaymode=92 and Desktopmode=1018

-SOUNDLIMIT: cuts (don't write to the output) the signal below
 "soundlimit" it doesn't play (only decode) while, and it finishes the play
 (exit or step to next song in playlist) in last 400 frame when volume is
 bellow or equal to soundlimit.
 Set it to 50 for disco, 10 for classical music, 1 to cut at 'digital noise'
 and 0 to disable soundlimit checking.

-VERBOSE: in verbose mode (-v) you get more informations (header info:layer,bitrate,etc.,
 ,ID3tag info:artist,title,year,...)(use it for -f0,-ff or -fl)

-TEST MODE: in test mode (-t) the program writes the output nowhere (null output)
 and you can test the speed of your computer and my program.
 You get the the results at the end of running.
 Index value must be above 100% to play properly audio (MP3) files.

-DISPLAYMODE configuration in mpxplay.ini:
 (default: 126 = 64+32+16+8+4+2; -fl: 2; -fl -v: 6=2+4; -fe -fs : 14=8+4+2)

12.  +4096  shift playlist entry up or down by mouse (drag & move) (otherwise scroll editorside)
13.  +8192  allways follow song-skip with the cursor/editorhighline (else follows only if it stands on the current/played song)
14. +16384  disable "move side with editorhighline" function (set old editorhighline/side moving method)

-LOADID3TAG configuration (default: 7 = 1+2+4)
0. +1: use mxu/extm3u/id3list
