Quick Usage Guide
=================

This is a quick usage guide of the Audio CD player built into DOSBox-X. A full
documentation is available as SJGPLAY.DOC inside the zip package SJGPLAY.ZIP.

You can simply type the command CDPLAY to start the CD player inside DOSBox-X.
It has a full-screen text-based graphical interface with easy-to-use features.

After the program is launched you can control it using either the keyboard or
the mouse. Type H for the help screen, P or ENTER to play the current track,
SPACE to pause/resume the playback, S to stop the track, or Q to quit program.

It accepts command-line arguments too if you want to run in command-line mode.
For example, you can play a track without launching its graphical interface.
Below are control-mode arguments that it accepts:
