1-Introduction
~ ~~~~~~~~~~~~
   Mp3 Jukebox is a Mp3, Mp2 (MPEG 1.0 and 2.0), Mod, S3m, Xm player for Dos,
   that try to emulate a turntable.

   The original idea was make a application to play songs file format like 
   mp3 / xm / mod... that could emulate a turntable, to mix and manipulate
   the songs like a vinyl. 
   All the programs that mix mp3s or mods require that the user have see 
   the monitor and to use the mouse, really I don´t like this method, I 
   want a program that can be used only with the keyboard without a monitor, 
   because for a DJ that is making a session only want heard the music,
   manipule your mix table and theirs turntables, the Dj don't need to be 
   seated, seeing a monitor to do a good mix or session.

6-Jukemp3.cfg  Drive Configuration file
~ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 In this file you specify the drive when the songs (mod and mp3) will be
 searched. If you put x like a drive the program will search in the current
 drive when the program has been executed.

 You can also specify the number of the CD-ROM drive, if you have several
 CD-ROMs in your system and you can play CD-AUDIO music from the second CD-ROM
 you must put the number 2 in jukemp3.cfg.


7-Command line options
~ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 General sintax:

      jukemp3 [options] [songs]

 You can specify songs to play from the command line.
 Ej:  jukemp3 c:\sound\track2.mp3              -> Play c:\sound\track2.mp3
      jukemp3 c:\trackers\*.xm c:\sound\*.mp3

 or if you are in windows, you can drag and drop song files to jukemp3.exe
 program.

 also you can use Winamp playlists:
      jukemp3 playlist.m3u

 -Options:

	-a     If you thing that the sound volumen is lower than the Windows
	       players use this option to amplify, but remember that if
	       you use it you won't be able to play talkover samples while
	       a mp3 is playing (Alt + Number).

	-nomp3 Any .mp3, .mp2 won't be inserted in the song list.

	-nomod No .Xm, .Mod, .S3m will be inserted.

	-fast  Use it if you need a instantly seek without delays in mp3 files
	       without this option when you use fast forward/rewind or go to
	       a marked position, the player spend a few miliseconds that
	       can dislike to the users if they are mixing.
	       This option is not recommended, I'm going to improve the seeking functions,
	       but for now this is the only solution if you need that the
	       player go quickly to a marked point of the song.

8-Samples
~ ~~~~~~~
   You can play sample .wavs (like voices,effects, jingles, etc...) while 
   a song is playing. You have to edit the file samples.ini, put one filename
   of the .wav in each line.
