hey windows programmers: i desperately need information about how to
access the Win32 API via INT 0x2F - as then, i'd be able to write a
DirectSound player device (as the DSound API is accessible from DOS) :)

Changes to OpenCP since version 2.0n:

OpenCP 2.5.0
  - major raise in the version number... hey, when EMagic can do this
    with Logic Audio, why shouldn't I? ;)
  - InterWave: * added correct panning for InterWave Step C or higher
               * fixed timing a bit
               * effects can now be turned off ;)
  - fileselector: choosing devices and soundcard inputs now works again ...
                  ... files submitted via the command line automatically
                  get played now again ...
                  ... and also, console output is no more written onto
                  the interface screen
                  (honestly, was I DRUNK when implementing that playlist
                   shit? ;)
  - included new ESS688 player device by Oleg Prokhorov (thanks!)
  - added "palette" setting to IW.INI to let you design your own ugly
    color scheme (tho, this is just a simple remapping, you can't change
    every single color)
  - bpm display is now finally DECIMAL :)
  - XM: notes with instrument number set some rows before will now
        play correctly
  - Mixer: nasty volume calculation bug causing hard-left panned samples
           to be phase-inverted removed (char? short? long? oh come on,
           what's the fuckin' difference? :)
  - IT: Pattern loader fixed (did crash/suck on some ITs)



OpenCP 2.0q_pre
  - fileselector: maybe there are no more LFN lookup bugs when using
                  DOS 6.x or certain 4DOS versions (feedback req'd!!!)
  - SID: now reads SMS $xx20 song info as song title when the file is
         in RAW format. Also characterizes SIDPlay infofiles as such
         in fileselector
  - new archive formats: LHA and ACE (thanks to tmbinc for this)
  - IT: doesn't confuse Kxx and Lxx effects anymore (oopsie :)
  - XM: made vibrato effect (4xx) somewhat weaker (never believed that
        they were to strong - until i found it out myself with my own
        MC6 entry :)
  - new WöRFEL MODE ][ (finally 320x200 ;)
  - included tool "WÅrfel Animator Professional" by Felix Domke (tmbinc)
    to generate your OWN WÅrfel Mode Animations
  - IT: portamentos "fixed" again (wonder which modules it NOW plays wrong)
  - fileselector: now shows some infos on various internal data files
  - restructured file selector a bit. the results:
    * .M3U AND .PLS PLAY LIST SUPPORT! YEAH! you can now simply select
      any .m3u or .pls play list from the file selector and all files
      it containeth will be loadeth! ;)
      (Beware, if your playlists contain long file names, they will of
       course only be loaded when you're running win95, i didn't include
       a "guess-the-right-filename" routine ;)
    * also reads MikIT .PLT play lists (thanks to Lemm for this)
    * In fileselector, you can now save a WinAmp-compatible .PLS play
      list with Alt-P
    * As a little side effect the actual playing module is now continued
      while eg. un-zipping the next (decreasing the pause between two
      modules a bit, but i may remove this again, as it MAY cause problems
      in win95 background between two modules. well, as always, i need
      feedback ;)
  - LAST "eval" release before the REAL one - Houston, the Eagle is just
    about, uhm, like, landing ;))



OpenCP 2.0p_31337:
  - increased the Quality Mixer's speed AND sound quality - now does
    jeff93.it fine on my P133 and those volume problems finally belong
    to the past
  - MP3: changed win95 bg playing scheme a bit - should now produce less
         (or maybe no?) clicks on some machines when running in foreground
  - MOD: the player now (hopefully) plays exactly like PT1.1B does -
         so DON'T blame me if OpenCP now plays your FT2-made MODs wrong.
         (if anyone could tell me how to recognize MODs saved by FT2,
          just contact me)
  - Therefore, new filetype added: MODf for FastTracker-made MODs
  - MOD: modt and m15t file types work again
  - XM: "set finetune" (E5x) command implemented (was ignored before)
  - CDA: re-enabled (was a typo in one of the sources, sorry ;)
  - new module type: MXM (from pascal's Tiny GUS Player) (EXPERIMENTAL!)
    * this format is size optimized, so don't expect any module or instrument
      names therein, it's just pure music ;)
    * in some converted .XMs, the loops seem incorrect, but i don't know
      if it's the fault of opencp or xm2mxm.exe
  - SID: RAW sidfile support, now supports raw C64 data files which follow
         the inofficial SMS ("Scene Music Standard") way of putting two
         JMPs to the Init and Play routine in front of the file
  - hopefully vastly increased stability when using wave table cards. At
    least with my IW, OpenCP, uhm, almost never crashes anymore :) (feedback
    on this required!!!)
