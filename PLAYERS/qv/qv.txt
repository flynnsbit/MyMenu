QuickView Pro Ver. 2.61 - DOS based Multimedia viewer


QuickView is Shareware. This means that you can test it for at most three
weeks. After that period you must register, i.e. pay a small registration
fee or discontinue using it. See REGISTER.TXT for details.

System Requirements
===================

QuickView Pro is a 32 bit protected mode program and therefore needs at
least a 80386 processor and a VGA card. It will run under DOS 3.0 or
better, or in a DOS shell under Windows 95/98/ME and OS/2. The DOS support
of Windows XP or later however is restricted so that QuickView will only 
run with limitations. Most ISA sound cards are supported as well as some 
PCI sound cards. You should take care that you have a VESA 2.0 compliant 
graphics card or driver as it has a high influence on the video playback
performance. Videos are scaled to full screen either by software or by
hardware if one of the supported graphics chips is present. These are most
chips from the following companies: 3Dfx Interactive, Inc., ATI (3D Rage,
Rage 128, Radeon), Matrox, Neomagic Corporation, nVidia Corporation (TNT,
GeForce), S3 Inc., Trident Microsystems. For a complete list look online
on the QuickView homepage.


Installation
============

Simply place all files of the package in the same directory. That's it!
QuickView will automatically detect your machine, memory and graphics card.
Since there is no installation necessary, the uninstall can be done
easily by deleting all files.
For sound support with a Sound Blaster or compatible you must have the
Environment variable BLASTER set containing port address, IRQ and DMA
channel or the appropriate ULTRASND variable for the Gravis UltraSound.
A Windows Sound System card is autodetected. There are external drivers
for PCI sound cards that you can download from 
http://www.multimediaware.com/qv/snddrv/


Command Line Format
===================

The command line format to run QuickView is:
QV [options] [filename]

filename can be a file that QuickView views or a name that contains the
wildcards * and ?.

Example: QV -A -Q2 VIDEO.AVI

Options
-------

An Option can start with a "-" or a "/". This documentation uses "-".
All parameters are case-insensitive. 

 -M  Select 25 lines menu mode. QuickView uses 50 line menu mode by
     default. For 25 lines you can use the -M option.

 -V  Don't use VESA. QuickView autodetects many graphics cards and uses
     VESA by default. The -V option tells QuickView to not use the VESA
     interface if installed, but if you want to use HiColor or TrueColor
     modes the VESA interface must be used. If your graphics card does not
     support VESA you can use a VESA TSR like Scitech Display Doctor (see
     below).

 -B  Don't autodetect video chipset. This also disables the detection of 
     video chips that are supported with hardware acceleration.

 -Rx Select screen resolution:
     x=1: 320x200
     x=2: 640x480
     x=3: 800x600
     x=4: 1024x768
     If a mode is not possible auto select will be used.
     default: auto select.

 -Wa,b,c,d,e Set sound card parameters
     a: card type:
        a=0: no sound card
        a=1: Sound Blaster or compatible and ESS
        a=2: Gravis UltraSound Classic or Max
        a=3: Windows Sound System
        a=4: enforce Sound Blaster Pro use 
        a=5: encorce Sound Blaster 2.0 use
             (You can also just use -W4 and -W5 as option. The other
              parameters will be taken from the BLASTER environment
              variable.)
        a=6: PC speaker sound. Note that the quality is low and that it
             doesn't work under Windows
     b: port address, hexadecimal
     c: IRQ
     d: DMA (for the Sound Blaster 16 or higher: Low DMA channel)
     e: high DMA channel (only for the Sound Blaster 16 or higher)
     Example: "-W1,220,5,1" for Sound Blaster, Port 220h, IRQ 5, DMA 1
     For no sound card, use -W0
     Use the -W parameter only if really necessary, for example if the
     program crashes when it tries to autodetect a sound card. Please note
     that your system might crash if you use wrong parameters.

 -WE$filename: Use external sound driver, example: -WE$D:\QV\VIA.SDR

 -Ox Set audio volume (x between 0 and 15).

 -@x Playlist file where x is a file name. Example: qv -@playlist.txt
     MP3 playlists (M3U files) can also be played: qv -@playlist.m3u

     A playlist file is a plain text file that contains file names with
     parameters that QuickView shall play one after another. The meaning
     of the parameters for each file in the playlist file is the same as
     described under Command Line Format. The playlist file must be a
     plain text file that you can write with any editor. It must not be
     a Word file or anything similar. Command line parameters that you
     give qv.exe at start are valid for the whole playlist file.
     Example: qv -R2 -@listfile.txt will use the 640x480 resolution with
     all pictures and videos in the playlist file. Parameters in a playlist
     file line are locally and only valid for the specified video, picture
     or sound file. You can make one loop if you write the following in a
     separate line:
     :l
     It stands for label and defines the position where QuickView shall
     return when it finds a
     :g
     This stands for goto label.
     Here is an example of a playlist file:

     -R2 -T100 picture.jpg
     :l
     -N -K0 video1.mpg
     -N -K0 video2.mpg
     :g

     It will display picture.jpg with 640x480 resolution for one second.
     Then it will play video1.mpg and video2.mpg without scaling in a
     never ending loop while picture.jpg is still visible in the
     background (if it wasn't overwritten by a video).
     Note: You can leave this loop only with ALT+X.

     The non-registered version allows to view at most 10 files with the
     playlist feature.

 -A  No sound with videos.

 -P  Preload and decompress AVI sound in advance. This will give better 
     performance with slower systems, especially if the sound is 
     compressed. However, you have to wait some time until the video begins
     to play. Preloading the sound will work only if you have sufficient
     memory of course. Thus, you won't be able to preload the sound of a
     whole movie since this would require memory in the gigabyte range.
     You won't get any sound in this case.

 -D  Don't drop frames if behind with AVIs and MPEGs. The sound will
     automatically be disabled with this option.

 -4  Don't use 320x240 mode. QuickView will use the 320x240 mode with all
     color depths by default if the video or picture is larger than 
     320x200. The 320x240 video mode with 256 colors is available on every 
     VGA card, however with HiColor and TrueColor only if they are 
     supported by the VESA BIOS. 320x240 is a non-standard VGA mode and may 
     cause problems. Turn off 320x240 support in this case.

 -Qx Video quality:
     x=0: TrueColor
     x=1: HiColor
     x=2: 256 colors
     x=3: Grayscale
     For details see under video options below. The default is HiColor if
     it was not changed in the config file. Note that not all video codecs
     offer TrueColor or HiColor quality.

 -Kx Type of video scaling:
     x=0: No scaling
     x=1: 2x scaling
     x=2: Software full screen scaling
     x=3: High quality scaling with DivX and H.264 codecs and MPEG-1 files, 
          otherwise normal software full screen scaling.
     x=4: Hardware full screen scaling. This is available with certain
          graphics chips only. If hardware scaling is not supported with
          your hardware, then software scaling will be used.
     Default: Full screen hardware scaling if available, otherwise
              software full screen. Note that software full screen
              requires some CPU power. If you get frame drops, select
              no scaling with -K0

 -UAx Select audio stream of AVI videos. x=0 is the default stream.

 -UB Use banked video memory access instead of linear frame buffer. Use
     this option if QuickView crashes while video playback or when showing
     pictures. Some VESA BIOSes (for example certain SiS chips) are buggy.

 -UD Disable MTRR register programming

 -UCx Select character set for subtitles. x=0: Western, x=1: Eastern,
     x=2: Cyrillic (Win-1251), x=3: Cyrillic (KOI-8R)

 -UF Don't show pictures full screen.

 -UG Use different volume programming for Sound Blaster compatible sound 
     chips

 -UH Don't use the hlt command if the system is idle. Using hlt helps
     to save power (important for Notebooks) and keep the CPU temperature
     low.

 -UI Don't check in advance if the sound with AVI playback will be decoded
     just in time but assume that there will be no sound buffer underruns.

 -UJ Use index to sync AVI video and audio during playback.

 -UK Use the BIOS to query the keyboard instead of direct programming. This
     way e.g. infrared remote controls can be used.
 
 -UM List only supported files in the menu.

 -UO Use speaker output instead of lineout with external sound driver

 -UPx Sound parameters (not supported by all sound chips):
 -UPB8  Enforce 8 bit sound
 -UPB16 Enforce 16 bit sound
 -UPC1  Enforce mono sound
 -UPC2  Enforce stereo sound
 -UPFx  Enforce sound sampling frequency x Hertz, example: -UPF22050
 -UPH   Enforce half sampling frequency
        Note: Some sound chips do not support all parameters.

 -UR Keep aspect ratio when showing pictures and videos full screen.

 -US Don't synchronize video playback with the vertical retrace of the
     monitor. If you use this option you might get tearing artefacts.
     However, synchronizing takes some time. If you're getting frame drops
     you should try to use this option.

 -SUBx  Select subtitle file for AVI. Example: -SUBd:\videos\film.sub
        Supported subtitle files are: SRT (SubRip), SSA (Sub Station
        Alpha), SUB (MicroDVD), SUB (SubViewer), TXT (TMPlayer)

 -VCDx  Start VideoCD playback. x is the track number. If you don't give
        a track number, track 2 will be assumed for VideoCDs and 1 for
        CD-i.

 -VCDSx Same as -VCDx but the second CD drive will be used.

 -MMX   Don't use MMX enhancements for video playback.

 -RND   Shuffle Play. Play the files given with wildcard in a random order
        (at most 10 in the non-registered version). Example: QV -RND *.MP3

 -LOW   Lower quality for slow computers. It is equivalent to 
        -UPB8 -UPC1 -UPH -US -K0
        Moreover, it limits the colors to HiColor.

 The following parameters are only available with the registered full 
 versions, i.e. neither with the shareware version nor in the registered 
 light version:

 -C  Don't switch to text mode after playing.

 -N  Don't set video mode. This can be used together with -C, -J, -X and -Y
     to display graphics around the video for example. You should take care
     that the color depth of the video mode that is set when you start
     QuickView is equal to the one that would be selected for the video or
     picture.

 -Fx Start AVI/MPEG at frame x or MP3 at time x (in 1/16 seconds).
	 Example: -F137

 -FPx Similar to the -Fx option, however means the x percentage of the 
	  total length here.

 -Gx End AVI/MPEG at frame x or MP3 at time x (in 1/16 seconds).

 -Lx Loop video and MP3 x times respectively, 0 means until key pressed,
     default for AVI/MOV/MP4/MPEG/MP3 is 1, default for CEL/FLI/FLC/DL is 
     0, default for GIF is the loop counter in the GIF.

 -Sx Set playback speed of AVI, CEL, DL, FLC, FLI and MPEG files. x is the
     time between two frames in microseconds.
     example: -s100000 gives 10 frames per second.
     The sound of videos will automatically be disabled with this option.

 -Tx Wait x/100 seconds after playing, 0 means wait for keypress.

 -Jx,y Size of the video or picture window, x is the horizontal size and y
     the vertical size. You can also use this option to correct the aspect 
     ratio of a video, e.g. 4:3 instead of 16:9. Example: -J300,200

 -Xx Position video or picture window at horizontal position x (must be a
     multiple of 4).

 -Yx Position video or picture window at vertical position x.

 -Zx Mouse and keyboard playback control. Each bit of x triggers a certain
     mouse or keyboard event:
     bit 0: Mouse move stops
     bit 1: Left mouse button press stops
     bit 2: Right mouse button press stops
     bit 3: Middle mouse button press stops (not supported with all mouse
            drivers)
     bit 4: Every key press stops
     bit 5: Ignore keyboard while playback (not evaluated if bit 4 is set)
     bit 6: Do not read keyboard at all while playback
     Example: stop video when mouse is moved or the left mouse button is
     pressed would be -Z3.

 -CAx,y Address of a callback routine. The callback routine will be called
        periodically during playback so that programmers can call QuickView
        as external program and get full control over the playback.
        x=R: Real mode address, then y in the form segment:offset
        y=P: Protected mode address, then y is the linear address.
        Further details upon request.


The Menu
========

QuickView always shows you all the files in the current directory, along
with all the visible subdirectory names. The arrow keys will move the file
selector bar around. CTRL+right or left move the file selector to the
next or previous supported file respectively.

By pressing a character the file selector bar jumps to the first file
starting with that character. Use lower case for files, upper case for
directories. A mouse is not supported.

To view a file or change a directory just hit Enter. If you try to view
a file QuickView does not handle nothing will happen. If you have tagged
some files QuickView will view these files without going to the menu in
between. Hit Enter or Tab if you want to view the next file and Backspace
for the previous one. Esc breaks and returns to the menu.

More keys during file selection
-------------------------------

 ALT+D: Change drive. A drive selection box will appear, prompting you for
        the drive letter you want to log onto. QuickView will attempt to
        change to the desired drive. If an error occurs, QuickView will
        remain logged onto the current drive.

 F1   : Help.

 F2   : Display information about the system.

 F3 or
 ALT+I: Get information on the currently selected file.

 F4   : Software Information.

 ALT+O: Change options of QuickView. For details see below.

 + -  : Increase or decrease resolution respectively. The currently
        selected resolution is highlighted. "Automatic" automatically
        selects the lowest resolution which will display the whole picture
        if possible.

 Space: Tag/untag the current file.

 ALT+T: Tag all files in the current directory.

 ALT+U: Untag all files.

 ALT+S: Shuffle Play. All files in the current directory are played in
        a random order. If you've already tagged files, only these files
        will will be played in a random order.

 ALT+L: Load subtitle file that will be played together with the next
        AVI video.

 ALT+M: Toggle between listing of all files and supported files only.

 ALT+R: Reread the directory
 
 Del  : Delete file.

 ALT+X: Exit QuickView.



Options in the menu
===================

Press the red characters to toggle the state of the option. You can also
use the up/down arrow keys and the Space bar. If you press "C" a
configuration file is created or updated. You are given the option to
save the command line parameters in the config file so that you don't have
to enter them with every start. Command line options override the config
file. Note that changing the use of VESA is only effective if you leave
QuickView and start it again.

Include 1280x1024 mode:
  Some monitors (mainly older ones) don't support the 1280x1024 screen
  mode. If you tell QuickView to support this mode your monitor might be
  damaged. Please consult your monitor handbook.

Use 320x240 mode instead of 320x200 if appropriate:
  For more details look at the -4 command line option.

Display images full screen:
  Note that 2 color pictures will not be scaled.

Keep video/picture ratio with scaling:
  Use the video/picture ratio instead of the 4:3 ratio of the monitor.


Video options
-------------

- Sound support: Play the sound of the videos?

- Preload sound: Look at -P command line option.

- Never drop frames: If you use this option, no frames will be dropped
  if the system is not fast enough. This option automatically disables
  sound.

- Loop: Use this if you want an AVI, MOV, MP4, MPEG or MP3 file to start 
  again after playing.

- Sync with monitor: Tearing artefacts can be avoided if frames are only
  updated when the monitor is in VSync. Note that you might get less frames
  per seconds if the option is enabled.

- Video quality (these options depend on the codec used):
   Grayscale: Usually the fastest playback mode
   8 color bits: 256 colors
   HiColor: 32768 or 65536 colors depending on the graphics card's features
   TrueColor: Will give the best quality with more than 16 million colors.
   Note: QuickView will use at most the amount of colors that the codec
   uses.

- Video Scale: Type of video scaling. Available options are:
   No scaling
   2x zoom: The video will be played twice as big. Note that 2x Zoom
     might require a higher screen resolution so that the video doesn't
     appear bigger.
   Software full screen: The video will be played full screen using
     software scaling. This is CPU very CPU intensive. On slower systems
     use one of the previous options.
   HiQ software full screen: High quality scaling with DivX and MPEG-1
     files, otherwise full screen software scaling
   Hardware full screen: The graphics chip's hardware scaling and color
     space conversion facilities will be used to play the video full 
     screen.

Questions & Answers
===================

-Q: I only see a black or garbled screen with video playback.
 A: Maybe the hardware video acceleration does not work (yet) for your
    graphics chip. Please use software scaling instead and notify the
    author.

-Q: Sound problems like:
    The sound doesn't work at all.
    The sound card isn't detected.
    Videos stop after the first frame.
    Sound parts are repeated over and over again.
    The sound quality is poor.
 A: Most of the time the reason for these problems are incorrect sound card
    settings in the BLASTER environment variable.
    There must be a command in your AUTOEXEC.BAT like this:
      SET BLASTER=Axxx Ix Dx Hx Pxxx Tx
    with
    A: Sound Blaster base I/O-port,
    I: IRQ,
    D: DMA low channel,
    H: DMA high channel (only required for SB16 or higher),
    P: MIDI port (not evaluated),
    T: Sound Blaster Type (not evaluated)

    Usual values are: A220, I5 or I7, D1, H5.
    If I5 does not work for you, try I7 and vice versa.

    For the original Sound Blaster there is a program called "DIAGNOSE.EXE"
    which programs the sound card configuration according to the values in
    the BLASTER variable. Use "DIAGNOSE /S" in your "AUTOEXEC.BAT".

    Under http://www.multimediaware.com/qv/sbdetect.zip there is a program
    that low level detects the Sound Blaster settings.

    For the Gravis UltraSound there must be the environment variable
    "ULTRASND".

    If your sound card is not detected properly, you can set the sound
    card parameter directly using the -W parameter.

    If the system info (F2 in the menu) says that a sound card was detected
    but you can't hear it with any file then check the volume. You can
    increase the volume with "+" while playback.

    If you don't get sound with videos but with MP3, WAV and VOC files then
    check if you enabled "Never drop frames". This will automatically
    disable sound. If you don't get sound with some AVI, MOV or MP4 files 
    only this might be because they are using an unsupported audio codec. 
    Check what audio codec the video uses by pressing File Info (F3). If 
    you either get the message "unsupported" or "unknown" then this audio 
    codec is currently unsupported. Other possible reasons are insufficient
    memory or a truncated file.

    If your sound chip cannot be made Sound Blaster compatible you can
    use an external sound driver. For the current status of the supported
    sound chips look at: http://www.multimediaware.com/qv/snddrv/

    Some sound cards like the ESS1868F do not work in a DOS session under
    Windows but only under pure DOS.

-Q: The video is played jerky.
    The sound is played with interruptions.
    Video and sound of AVI files are not in sync.
 A: If the video itself wasn't captured with a low frame rate, this usually
    indicates that your system is too slow. QuickView will not show all
    frames of the video so that the sound can be played without
    interruptions. But this can also fail if your system is far too slow.

    In order to improve the video playback with slow systems you should use 
    the -LOW parameter. It will lower the sound quality (-UPB8 -UPC1 -UPH), 
    choose no scaling (-K0), disable synchronization with the vertical 
    retrace (-US) and limit the number of colors to HiColor. If this is not 
    sufficient you can select 256 colors or grayscale using the -Q 
    parameter. Also, try copying the file to your hard disk instead of 
    playing it from CD.

    If there are problems with the playback of certain AVI videos, then try
    the -UI Option.

    If you encounter audio/video sync problems with AVI videos then try the
    -UJ option.

-Q: Why is the video quality bad with some videos?
 A: This might be because you don't have a TrueColor or HiColor card or you
    don't have a VESA driver in your system. In the latter case you should
    use the VESA TSR for your graphics card or Scitech Display Doctor,
    available on many FTP-servers, BBSs, from Shareware distributors or on
    my WWW page. The VESA driver must conform at least to version 1.2 of
    the VESA standard. Versions prior to 1.2 of the VESA standard did not
    define TrueColor and HiColor modes.

-Q: I get memory error messages with some files. What can I do?
 A: Select a lower number of colors, e.g. HiColor instead of TrueColor.
    Turn off sound.

-Q: I can't forward and rewind AVIs.
 A: Either the AVI has no index or a bad index, or it does not have
    keyframes, or there is not enough memory.

-Q: The text screen is messed up after hardware scaling was used.
 A: Scaling doesn't work properly with your graphics card. Choose a
    different scaling type than hardware full screen.

-Q: I get some lines on the graphics screen with my ATI Mach graphics card
    under Windows 95/98.
 A: Try M64VBE with parameter S
 
-Q: I get a black or garbled screen when I start QuickView.
 A: Try starting the program with the parameter -B.

-Q: I don't have a sound card and I'd like to hear the sound through the
    PC speaker.
 A: Use the -W6 parameter.

-Q: I like the 25 lines menu more. How can I select this mode permanently?
 A: Press ALT+O in the menu. Then you can select 25 lines with "5" and
    write a config file with "C".

-Q: What do I have to do to make QuickView run under Windows NT or XP?
 A: The software will only run with limitations under Windows NT or XP.
    You must open a DOS full screen session. Some video drivers have bugs
    with the VESA support. If you only see color garbage or a black screen
    (because the monitor doesn't synchronize any more) then use a fixed
    screen resolution that works either by using the -Rx parameter or by
    choosing the resolution in the menu with the "+" key. Example: QV -R2
    will use 640x480 as screen resolution which works with many graphics
    chips. Sound however is still a problem under Windows XP and NT. You
    can try VDMSound, a soundcard emulator for MS Windows NT/2000 DOS
    boxes.

-Q: What do I have to do to make QuickView run under OS/2?
 A: You have to set the following definitions for the DOS session:
    INT_DURING_IO: ON
    IDLE_SENSIVITY: 100
    HW_TIMER: ON
    VIDEO_RETRACE_EMULATION: OFF
    AUDIO_ADAPTER_SHARING: REQUIRED
    DPMI_DAS_API: ENABLED
    Make sure the BLASTER or ULTRASND environment variable is set properly.
    The OS/2 Sound Blaster drivers seem to have a DMA handling problem in
    a DOS session which sometimes causes a lockup with sound output. Try to
    get an updated sound card driver. If that doesn't help, please either
    turn off sound or run the program under plain DOS. Also, some OS/2
    sound drivers don't handle 16 bit sound properly. If you only hear
    a strange noise use the -w4 parameter to enable Sound Blaster Pro
    compatibility.

-Q: How do I use QuickView's AVI, MOV, MPEG video and audio support with
    Arachne (DOS WWW browser)?
 A: You should use the APM package of QuickView that is available under
    http://www.multimediaware.com/qv/qv.apm. The MIME types will be
    configured automatically.

-Q: What is a codec?
 A: Video and audio sequences are compressed and decompressed by routines
    called codecs (short for compressor/decompressor). A codec is
    responsible for compressing raw video or audio data into a format
    suitable for distribution. When you play the compressed video or audio
    sequence, the codecs integrated in QuickView perform a reverse role,
    converting the compressed data into images or sound that can be played
    on your system.

-Q: I have problems with VideoCD and CD-i playback
 A: Not all CD drives allow proper raw reading of CDs which is necessary
    for VideoCD and CD-i playback. This especially applies to Windows.
    For playback of VideoCDs under Windows access the videos as normal
    files that are usually named AVSEQ01.DAT, AVSEQ02.DAT and so on.

    On the other hand, most DOS CD drivers do not support reading of these
    files under DOS. The directory is visible but the files itself cannot
    be accessed. Use the -VCD command under DOS to play a VideoCD or CD-i.

    Some CD drives spin down the motor too fast after reading. When new
    data is required they take a few seconds until they are active again.
    This results in playback pauses. If your CD driver allows to increase
    the spin down time you should try this.
