SJGPlay for DOS               Version: 1.29            (C)1996 Steve J. Gray
===============               Dec 5, 1996              =====================

Welcome to SJGPLAY: The Audio CD Player with Lyrics... and more!

SJGPLAY is FREEWARE, which means:

    You may use it without payment of any kind. However, I retain full 
    copyrights to the program. You may not modify, sell, or use it for 
    commercial purposes. You may include it in FREEWARE/SHAREWARE 
    compilations provided all files and documentation (SAMPLES.ZIP may be
    removed if there are concerns about copyrighted lyrics) are included
    and un-modified (I'd appreciate being informed if you plan to include
    SJGPLAY on a CD-ROM. I'd accept a free copy of any CD containing
    SJGPLAY too... Hey, it's worth a try :-)

That said... If you use this program I'd like to hear your comments or 
suggestions (tell me your most and least favorite features). I can be reached 
via e-mail at: sgray@acs.ryerson.ca

NOTE!: As of version 1.26 file naming conventions have changed! Lyric files 
~~~~~~ now have the format "CDxxxxxx.Tnn" (so that they will be sorted 
       correctly in the "ALL" Catalog). 
       
       To fix YOUR data files go into the data files directory and use the 
       DOS rename command, like this: REN CD??????.0* CD??????.T*

  The SAMPLES.ZIP file (if included in the archive) contains data files for most 
of my personal CD collection as well as over 100 songs. (Note: Maintenance 
releases may not include the SAMPLES.ZIP file). I hope you find some you can
use... It may save you some typing and let you see the lyrics features in 
action. You have two options: 

 1. Unzip SAMPLES.ZIP, then use the catalog feature to see which CD's are 
    included in the sample data. Feel free to delete the CD's you don't need.

 2. Use the EXTRACT FROM ZIP feature when you put a new CD in the drive. If
    it's included in the SAMPLES.ZIP file the info for it will be extracted.
    
 If you find we have some CD's in common how 'bout typing and sync'ing the 
missing lyrics from the sample CD's. If you e-mail them to me or send them to 
me on disk I can include them in future releases. 

    My snail-mail address is:  Steve Gray
                               10 Crestview Ave.,
                               Brampton, Ontario
                               Canada  L6W-2R6

    My e-mail address is.....: sgray@acs.ryerson.ca
    My World Wide Web page is: http://www.acs.ryerson.ca/~sgray


  ALSO, new in Version 1.28, is the file EXTRAS.ZIP. This file contains a
sample message file, some new fonts (for both SJGPlay and your VGA card), a
font exporter program, and documentation for those who want to try the new 
font and message features. 


DISCLAIMER
==========

  Since I wrote SJGPLAY for my own pleasure, and I'm not asking for any
money, please don't expect support of any kind. I will try to fix any bugs
that pop up, but since I don't own every combination of CD-ROM drive and
computer I may not be able to do anything if it doesn't work properly on
your system.

  If you want to report a bug please try to include the following information
when you e-mail me:

  * SJGPLAY version AND date (very important!)
  * CD-ROM drive and interface (SoundBlaster, SCSI, EIDE, proprietary, etc)
  * DOS and MSCDEX version
  * CPU type or any other hardware you think might be causing problems

  SJGPLAY works on my system and on several systems at work. All CD-ROM
manipulation is handled by the (registered shareware) "Audio CD Toolkit"
library by DSE SOFTWARE PUBLISHING and uses MSCDEX to interface to the 
CD-ROM unit.

  SJGPLAY is provided as is. The author shall not be liable for any damages
resulting in use or misuse of this program including... Hey, I'm no lawyer,
you know the routine...


INTRODUCTION
============

  You've probably heard this before but... I've tried several other CD audio
player programs and none of them had all the features I wanted. I tried both
DOS and WINDOWS programs but wasn't impressed. I figured I could do better,
but until ACDKIT from DSE came along I couldn't do anything about it.

  I've tried to make SJGPLAY as easy to use as possible, yet also have all
the features and capabilities found in other CD Players, and more! SJGPlay is
designed to be uncluttered and clean. You can even remove most of the display
information if you want to. You only see what you want to see and the
controls are intuitive (usually the first letter of the function). There is
a built-in help screen available any time if you need it, but once you're 
comfortable with the controls you shouldn't need it again. I believe in 
functionality not window-dressing...

  I've always favoured DOS more than WINDOWS. I think everybody should be
able to use my program, and DOS is the common denominator (for now...). Even 
older PC's should be able to run SJGPLAY without any problems. SJGPLAY will 
also run (as a DOS application) under WINDOWS (and runs even better under 
Win95...once you disable the default player). See your Windows manual for 
information on how to install DOS applications on your desktop (I like to run 
SJGPLAY in a window).

 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 NOTE: A Windows version is now in development (Win 3.1 and Win 95/NT).

FEATURES
========

  SJGPlay has most, if not all, of the features you will ever need in a CD
audio player plus a few you'd never expect to find... I've tried to 
incorporate all the features I could think of, while keeping in mind the 
limitations of DOS text-mode. I'm open to suggestions if you can think of 
anything that could be added (see: Ideas for future versions). I've tried to 
make it easy to use, so almost no documentation is required (but here it is 
anyway :-). Hope you like it!

RUNNING THE PROGRAM
===================

  The only file that is REQUIRED is SJGPLAY.EXE. If no configuration file
is found, built-in defaults will be used. The program will search the current
directory when looking for the configuration file (SJGPLAY.CFG) and all data
files UNLESS a path is set via the SJGPLAY environment variable (see below) 
or in a secondary config file as specified by "CONFIG:" on the command line.

  If you want to run SJGPlay from anywhere regardless of the current
directory you should place SJGPLAY.EXE somewhere in your DOS path or add the
SJGPlay directory to your path, for example: 
  
        PATH C:\DOS;C:\UTILS\SJGPLAY
        
        Then, to allow SJGPlay to find the CD and Lyrics files you 
        must add the following line to your AUTOEXEC.BAT file:

        SET SJGPLAY={path}

        where {path} is the complete path to your files.
        For example: SET SJGPLAY=C:\UTILS\SJGPLAY


  If you don't use the above method then you will need to change into the
proper directory first by using the CD (change directory) command. For
example: CD \UTILS\SJGPLAY

  To start the program simply type: SJGPLAY

  If you want to specify a secondary configuration, conditionally run the
program, or control CD's via batch files see the section titled "Command-line 
arguments"

  When the program first runs the program will look for the files SJGPLAY.MSG
and SJGPLAY.FNT. If they exist they will automatically be loaded. These files
provide alternate messages and fonts that can be used to modify the look of
SJGPlay or translate the messages to another language. If you uncompress the
EXTRAS.ZIP file and DO NOT want the included example MSG and FNT files to be
loaded you must either move, rename or delete the files from the directory.

DATA FILES
==========

  All data files are strictly text-based. Filenames are constructed using a
number based on the total number of FRAMES on a CD. A frame is 1/75th of a
second in length. Most CD's should have a unique number of frames which will
allow the program to automatically use the correct data files. We'll call
this number {idnum} from now on. The largest this number can be is about
351,000 (78 minutes * 60 seconds/min * 75 frames/sec).

  The CD Title and Track titles are stored as plain text in a file with the
format: CD{idnum}.CD (example: CD123456.CD).

  Lyrics and synchronization data are stored as plain text in a file with the
format: CD{idnum}.T{tracknum}, where {tracknum} is a two-digit number
corresponding to the specific track (example: CD123456.T01).

  Album files, which contain lyrics for an entire album in one file, are 
stored as plain text in a file with the format: CD{idnum}.ALB

Why text files?
---------------

  Every time I tried a new CD player program I had to re-enter each CD since
they all seemed to have their own format for storing their database info.
I wanted my program to be able to read standard text files so that data can
easily be shared with other programs. Textfiles are universal so CD info and
lyrics can easily be sent electronically and people can share their stuff.
There are sites on the internet that contain lyrics files, so you might be
able to download (ftp) them instead of re-typing them. Try these sites:

        ftp.informatik.tu-muenchen.de
        ftp.sunet.es/pub/music/lyrics
        http://archive.uwp.edu/pub/music/lyrics
        http://muic.wit.com/uwp/music/artists
        http://www.yahoo.com/Entertainment/Music/Lyrics

  I'm hoping people will start to distribute synchronized lyrics. They don't
add too much to the size of the file and the files are still readable for
those who don't have a CD-ROM player (or this program...). 

  The only drawbacks to text files are that they take up a lot of harddrive
space (especially drives with large cluster sizes) and they tend to clutter
up the directory (If this is a problem I may consider changing this). 

  If/when you've typed in the lyrics for a complete album you can replace all 
the individual lyrics files with one big "Album" file (see the utilities 
section). This should clear up some of the clutter and reduce the space
requirements on your hard drive.


SCREEN LAYOUT
=============

The screen is divided into three sections...

The top section:

   At the very top left is a red square to quit the program using the mouse.
Also on the left is the CD title and Track title. On the right is the current
time-of-day and status. The status displays whether the CD is paused or
playing or if the CD tray is open. It will also indicate when you are in
SYNCHRO mode, FINETUNE mode, or which line you are editing in EDIT mode.
When full-screen mode is enabled the time-of-day will be replaced by a
"H=Help" message. 

  The top and middle sections are divided by a green line with a travelling 
"frame-blip" which zips across the line when the CD is being played. If you 
have a mouse you can click on the "|" symbol or press the "|" key to toggle 
between different mouse "Button-bars" or a VU Meter (requires soundblaster).

The middle section:

  This is where all the action is. It is used to display or edit various
information as selected by the current mode. The current display mode name is
displayed in the bottom section (if enabled) at the very bottom right of the
screen.

The bottom section:

  Displays all the track, time, and mode information. Dividing the middle and
bottom sections is the green time-bar indicator which shows elapsed track
progress. Below is the track number and time indicator using large digits. To
the left of the time display is the time mode indicator, indicating elapsed
or remaining time for either the track or entire CD. If program mode is
enabled the step# will be displayed to the left of the track number. On the
right side of this section is the total CD time, current drive unit, elapsed
track percentage, repeat mode and the current display mode. Also there is a
small white square to enable full-screen mode with the mouse.

  When full-screen mode is enabled the bottom section is not displayed.

MOUSE CONTROL
=============

  You can use the mouse to control most functions. The RIGHT mouse button
works just like the TAB or M keys to cycle to the next display mode or if on
the third line cycles the button bars. The MIDDLE mouse button (if you have 
one) operates like the SHIFT-TAB key to cycle to the previous display mode.

  The operation of the LEFT mouse button changes depending on the position of 
the pointer and which display mode is selected. For easier mouse control 
activate the mouse "Button-bars" by clicking one of the "|" symbols on the 
third line. Each time you click it will cycle to the next "bar" (there are 
three plus a VU Meter).

  Note: The mouse is inactive when you are in EDIT MODE!

JOYSTICK CONTROL
================

  The 4 joystick buttons (One 4-button or Two 2-button joysticks) may be 
configured to control the program by simulating key presses. With 4 buttons
there are 15 combinations, each combination generating a character. Each
button represents a value (A=1, B=2, C=4, D=8). By adding the value of each
button you get a number from 1 to 15 corresponding to the position in the
control string (Does this seem like binary to anyone? You're right it is!).

  Control String: ABCDEFGHIJKLMNO
  --------------  |||||||||||||||
  Button A...(1)- x x x x x x x x   ('x' indicates the button is down)
  Button B...(2)-  xx  xx  xx  xx
  Button C...(4)-    xxxx    xxxx
  Button D...(8)-        xxxxxxxx

  Example: to make the program stop playback when both button A and B are 
  ~~~~~~~~ pressed together... A=1, B=2. 1+2=3. Therefore, in the control
           string at position 3 put an "S" ("S"=Stop).

  Note: The program responds when all buttons are RELEASED. 
  ~~~~~ For multiple button presses:
           > Press and hold one button 
           > Press the other button(s) 
             (You don't need to hold each button, it will be remembered)
           > Release the first button.

  Note2: This might seem weird but I figured it could be used as a
  ~~~~~~ kind of "remote control". If you could find a wireless joystick
         it would be even better... Alternately, you could wire up a custom
         "remote" using buttons and diodes... Please e-mail me if you do!

  Note3: The default keys are set up for my Gravis GamePad. The buttons are
  ~~~~~~ configured like this: Red=1, Yellow=2, Blue=4, Green=8.

         Red=Play(P), Green=Mode(M), Red+Green=Toggle Full(F),
         Blue=Next track(+), Yellow=Prev track(-), Blue+Yellow=Stop(S),
         All 4 buttons=Toggle Video(V), Any other combination=Pause(space)

  Tip:   If you want to toggle between specific display modes without having
  ~~~~   to TAB (or M) through the 8 regular modes, use "," instead of "M"
         in the control string, then put your favorite modes into the 
         Display Timer list and enter 99999 as the delay time.


PROGRAM CONFIGURATION
=====================

  Press F9 to display the configuration screen. Use CURSOR UP/DOWN/HOME/END 
to select an option, then use LEFT or RIGHT to change the setting.

  To save the current settings press the W key. Settings are saved in the
directory specified in the SJGPLAY environment variable or to the current
directory if that is not set. The configuration file is a plain text file and 
contains lines in the form "xxxx = nn", where "xxxx" is the name of the 
configuration setting (as displayed under the NAME column) and "nn" is a 
value for that setting (0 being NO, and 1 being YES). Valid values are 
displayed under the RANGE column.

DISPLAY MODES
=============

  Rather than cluttering up the display with too much information, the
program lets you choose what you want to see. This is the display mode, and
it occupies the entire middle of the screen, or all but the top three lines
when in full-screen mode.

  Each mode gives you specific information as follows:

    KEY  MODE     DESCRIPTION
    ---  ----     -----------
    F1   Playlst  List of tracks to play (Playlist) (.=has lyrics)
    F2   CD Info  Track number,PrgFlag, Times, Flag and Titles (*=has lyrics)
    F3   Lyrics   Paged-style lyrics synchronized to playback
    F4   Karaoke  Karaoke-style lyrics synchronized to playback
    F5   Track    Track Title in large letters
    F6   CDTitle  CD Title in large letters
    F7   FreqBrs  Frequency Bars (simulated spectrum analyzer)
    F8   Scope    Waveform scope
    F9   Config   Configuration Screen
    F10  About    Program info, including version number
    F11  Catalog  Catalog for CD's, Lyrics, Albums or All
    F12  Utils    Utilities Help Screen


F1 - Playlist:

  Track numbers displayed in the order they will be played. Normally all
tracks on the CD will be shown in numerical order from 1 to the total number
of tracks on the CD. Track numbers are displayed inside a box. The currently
selected or playing track will be displayed in red, all others will be blue. 
Tracks with lyrics have a "." displayed after the track number.

  When program mode is enabled, only those tracks that are programmed will
appear. A small yellow "marker" (or cursor) appears which can be moved about
for program editing (adding or deleting tracks).

F2 - CD Info:

  All tracks on the CD are listed in track-order. The track number, PRG flag,
time, lyric flag and title are shown. Titles may be edited and saved so that 
next time the CD is inserted they will automatically appear. The track time
displayed will change depending on the currently selected "time mode". This
can be elapsed track or CD time, remaining track or CD time, or a frame
number.

  The PRG flag indicates if the track is included in the programmed playlist.
If a "+" is displayed the track is included once. If a "*" is displayed the
track is included 2 or more times. The prg flag will only be displayed when 
program mode is enabled.

  The lyric flag indicates if there are lyrics available for the track.
Tracks shown with "*" have lyrics available. Tracks shown with a "-" do not.

  The currently playing track is highlighted. If there are more tracks on the
CD than can fit on the screen the list will shift up or down so that the
currently playing track is as close to the middle as possible.

F3 - Lyrics

  Lyrics will be displayed in a paged format, synchronized to playback. Each
line will be highlighted as it is sung. Just before the line is sung a small
"traffic light" indicator will light red, yellow, then green indicating the
time remaining until the line is sung:

  Red square     - More than 1 second
  Yellow square  - Less than 1 second..... Get ready!
  Green triangle - Less than 1/4 second... Sing it! (if you want to...)

  If no lyrics have been entered the message "Lyrics not available" will be
displayed followed by the required filename.

F4 - Karaoke

  Lyrics will be displayed in Karaoke format, synchronized to playback. Each
line will be displayed in very large letters as it is sung. The next line
to be sung will be displayed in small letters just below, with the same
"traffic light" indicator as above. If no lyrics have been entered, "Lyrics 
not available" will be displayed.

  The lyrics are displayed in a large proportionally-spaced font. The number 
of lines available depends on the screen mode and whether full-screen is 
enabled. Four lines are available in 25-line mode with full-screen on. If
full-screen mode is off one less line will be visible (keep this in mind 
when typing lyrics).

F5 - Track

  Displays the current Track Title in large letters.

F6 - CDTitle

  Displays the current CD Title in large letters.

F7 - Frequency Bars

  Displays a simulated "spectrum analyzer" of the SoundBlaster input.

F8 - Scope

  Displays a waveform of the SoundBlaster input.

F9 - Configuration Screen

  Displays a configuration screen where startup options and program options
can be set. Options such as intro time and fast-forward time take effect
immediately when changed.

F10 - About Screen

  Displays freeware message, program version number, and author info.

F11 - CD Catalog

  Loads and displays a catalog of CD's, lyrics, Albums or All files. You can 
delete or edit entries or sort the list by number, time (frames) or title.

F12 - Utility Help Screen

  Displays descriptions of available utilities. It also displays the CD Frame
Accuracy. This number is a reflection of CPU type, CPU speed, CD-ROM response 
time, cd-rom driver efficiency etc. The lower the number the better your 
system. This is important for lyric timing and playback. If, for example, the
number is 10 then lyric timing will be accurate to 10/75th's of a second.


ABOUT CD-ROM DRIVES
===================

  Not all CD-ROM drives are equal. In order to get the most accurate lyrics
playback SJGPlay constantly polls the CD-ROM drive. The response time of the
drive is the MAJOR factor determining the overall feel of the program. If 
your drive is slow, mouse clicks might be ignored, the frequency bars will be
slow, etc. The response time of the CD-ROM drive has nothing to do with its
speed (ie: SINGLE, DOUBLE, QUAD etc), it's more a reflection of how efficient 
its internal firmware responds to requests from the computer. All CD-ROMS
spin at "single" speed while playing audio CD's.

  As a basis for comparison, here are the response times of some drives I 
have tested:

   TIME  DRIVE              SPEED  INTERFACE  COMMENT
   ====  =====              =====  =========  =======
   0-1   PANASONIC CR-562B  2x     AT-BUS     Lightning fast
   1-2   TOSHIBA XM-3301B   1x     SCSI       Good
   1-2   TOSHIBA XM-3501B   4x     SCSI-2     Good
   3-4   NEC 4x4 CHANGER    4x     IDE/ATAPI  Average
   7-8   PHILIPS PCA42CR    4x     IDE/ATAPI  Slow
 * 36-37 PINNACLE RCD-5040  4x/2x  SCSI-2     Dreadfully slow *
         (* CD-ROM Recorders are notorious for being poor readers)


PLAYING CD'S
============

  There are two playback modes; standard or programmed. Standard mode
consists of all tracks in numerical order. Programmed mode is a list of
tracks in any order. In programmed mode you can select only those tracks that
you want or even repeat tracks. You can have up to 99 programmed "steps". 
When program mode is enabled the step number will be displayed at the bottom 
left of the screen beside the track number. In either case (standard or 
programmed) the order of the tracks will be referred to as the "playlist".

  At the top right of the screen is the status indicator. It will indicate
the status of the CD and drive. If no CD is inserted it will say "open". If
a CD is inserted but not playing it will say "stopped".

  Use the "P" key or ENTER to play the currently selected track. If the CD is
not playing, pressing "+" or "-" will select a track. When the CD is playing
the status indicator will say "playing". To pause playback press SPACE. The
status indicator will flash "paused". To resume playback press SPACE again.
To stop playback press the "S" or "." keys. If you press "S" or "." when the
CD is already stopped it will reset to the beginning of the playlist 
(ie: press "SS" to go to step 1).

  The "+" and "-" keys will jump to the next or previous track. If you are at
the beginning or end of the playlist it will wrap around. To jump to a
specific track enter a two-digit track number (this only works if program
mode is NOT enabled!). When you enter the first digit it will be displayed
followed by a "?" flashing at the bottom left of the screen reminding you
that another digit is needed. If you enter an invalid first digit or track
number it will not be accepted and the flashing message will be cleared. To
clear an incorrect first digit press the BACKSPACE key.

  To control playback of an individual track (shuttle) use the CURSOR KEYS. 
The cursor LEFT key or ALT-LEFT key will reverse (rewind). The cursor RIGHT 
key or ALT-RIGHT key will fastforward. The cursor UP and DOWN keys will 
reverse or fast forward by twice the time of the LEFT and RIGHT cursor keys. 
The fastforward and reverse times can be adjusted in the configuration screen.
The HOME key will re-start playback from the beginning of the CURRENT track.
The END key will jump to a point near the end of the current track.

Note: When in edit, program, config or catalog mode the normal cursor keys
~~~~~ control the cursor or scroll the catalog. In these modes use the ALT
      cursor keys to control track shuttle.

Repeat Modes:
-------------

  The "R" key cycles between the following REPEAT modes:

    OFF - No repetition. Displayed as (---)
    ONE - Repeats the currently selected track. 
    STP - Single Track Play. Stops playback after each track ends.
          You must press P to play the next track.
    ALL - Repeats the entire CD
    DRV - Repeats all CD's in all available Drive units

  The DRV repeat mode is only available if you have more than one CD-ROM
drive (or a CD changer configured with separate drive letters). This allows 
you to have continuous music playback. When one CD is finished the CD in the 
next drive will play and so on. When the last CD has played it will repeat 
back to the first drive. If a drive has no CD inserted, DRV mode will be
cancelled.

  Pressing "A" or "B" selects segment repeat mode, which repeats the selected
section of the CD. Press "A" at the start of the segment. The repeat
indicator will show (A- ). Press "B" at the end of the segment. The repeat
indicator will show (A-B) and the segment will repeat over and over. While
the segment is repeating you may press "B" to reduce the segment time even 
further. To cancel A-B repeat mode press "R".


Intro Mode:
-----------

  Pressing "I" will enable INTRO mode. The word "INTRO" will flash just to
the left of the time indicator. This will play the beginning of each track 
then jump to the next track. When intro mode is enabled repeat mode is set to 
"ALL". If intro mode is enabled after playback has passed the intro period, 
it will jump to the next track immediately. Pressing "I" again disables intro 
mode. The intro time is adjustable via the configuration screen.


CHANGING THE DISPLAY
====================

  Use the "TAB" or "M" keys to switch to the next display mode. Use SHIFT-TAB
to switch to the previous display mode. The (SHIFT)TAB/M keys will only
switch from F1 to F8 modes. To jump to a specific display mode press the 
desired FUNCTION KEY (F1 to F12).

  Use the "F" key to toggle full-screen mode. When full-screen mode is on,
the bottom section is removed and the selected display mode is extended to
the bottom of the screen.

  If you have a VGA display you may use the "V" key to toggle the video mode
between 25 lines or 43/50 lines as set in the configuration.

  Press the "H" key to display a help screen with a summary of the most
common control keys. Also displayed on the help screen is the {idnum} for the
current CD. Press "H" again to return to the previous display mode or choose
a specific mode by pressing the proper function key.

  Press the "T" key to change the time display. The time display can show
elapsed or remaining time for either the current track or the entire CD. It
can also display the track FRAME number. The track frame number is used to
synchronize the lyrics to playback. A frame is one seventy-fifth of a second,
which gives very precise control over lyric timing. Depending on the speed
of your computer and how your CD-ROM is connected (SCSI, IDE, parallel port
etc) this number may change smoothly or jump many numbers at a time (on MY
computer the last digit is just a blur :-) ) Press "U" to display the utility
help screen to see a display of the frame accuracy for your system.

  Note: Since only the last 5 digits of the track frame number are displayed,
  ~~~~~ after 22:16 the frame number will appear to reset to zero.

  Note2: Times are read directly from the disc and may not match those
  ~~~~~~ printed on the CD and/or jewel case.

  Most key commands will operate the same regardless of the DISPLAY mode.
For example, you can press "+" to jump to the next track even when help is
being displayed. 
  
  When in EDIT mode the opposite is true. Obviously, typing a letter will
insert it into the edit field, therefore you can't change modes or tracks, or
change the time display while in edit mode. When in edit mode the only
control of the CD you have is via the ALT plus CURSOR keys to control 
playback of the CURRENT track. To exit EDIT mode press ENTER (if a single 
field) or ESC (with multiple fields). The mouse is inactive during edit mode!

  The other exceptions are the NORMAL cursor control keys. The cursor keys 
usually control track shuttle except in the following cases:
 
 Program mode........they move the yellow marker
 Configuration mode..they move the cursor and change option settings
 Catalog Mode........they scroll the catalog
 
  When in these modes you can use the ALT-CURSOR keys for shuttle control just
like in edit mode.


FREQUENCY BARS, SCOPE, VU METER
===============================

  These functions (F7,F8, "|") require a fast computer with a SoundBlaster
or compatible card. The sound output from your CD-ROM drive must be connected 
to either the internal CD-line connector or to the line input of the 
SoundBlaster card and you must use the software that came with the sound card
to set the recording source to the corresponding input. The "BLASTER"
environment variable must be set correctly in your AUTOEXEC.BAT for these
modes to work! See your SoundBlaster manual for instructions. For best results
make sure the input volume is set as high as possible. 

F7 - Frequency Bars

  This displays a SIMULATED spectrum analyzer. In a REAL spectrum analyzer
the bars correspond to specific frequencies; low frequencies on the left and
higher frequencies to the right. The louder the frequency the higher the bar.
Eventually I'd like to have a real spectrum analyzer but for now it's just
simulated... Now the bars are more like "waveform delta" bars. At least it's
interesting to watch (hopefully). The following keys adjust the bars:

  { and } ....Set sampling size. "{"=faster/lower, "}"=slower/higher.
              (Set this according to the speed of your computer)
  ; and ' ....Shift bars left/right. There are 127 bars but only a few are
              visible depending on the bar width.
  : and " ....Set bar width. ":"=Smaller, """=Bigger.
  INS ........Toggle display of the above settings.

F8 - Scope

  This displays the waveform of the sound input much like an oscilloscope. On
a really fast computer you may need to adjust the delay between samples. On a
slow computer you may only see what appears to be random dots. When no sound
is input you should see a straight line all the way across the middle of the
screen. The following keys adjust the scope:

  { and } ....Adjust the sampling delay.
  : ..........Reset the sampling delay to zero (fastest display).
  " ..........Toggle slow-motion.
  INS ........Toggle the display of the delay setting.

  Note: Sometimes these modes don't work (at least for me) while running 
  ~~~~~ under Windows or even AFTER running windows. You may need to turn the
        computer off and back on again to reset the SoundBlaster card.

"|" - VU Meter

 The VU meter is available by using the "|" key or mouse to cycle the frame
blip (3rd line of the screen) to mouse button-bars, and then to the VU meter.


DEVICE CONTROL AND EXITING
==========================

  If you have more than one CD-ROM drive unit attached to your computer you
may select which one you control by pressing the "<" and ">" keys to select
the previous or next drive. To select a specific unit press ALT plus the unit
number (ie: ALT-1 or ALT-2 etc, to the maximum number of units). 

  Note: On startup the program will automatically select the first CD unit 
  ~~~~~ that is currently playing. If no CD's are playing then the first 
        CD unit will be selected.

  To display a listing of which discs are in each drive use the "`" key.
This will scan all connected drives and display the drive letter, IDNUM, and
Disc Title for each unit.

  Switching to another unit switches control completely to the new unit. If 
the previous unit was playing it will continue to play, however, any and 
all control of that unit is lost (track order, repeat etc). Switching from 
one unit to another may cause the new unit to jump to another track if 
"use programmed playlist if available" is enabled and the currently playing 
track is not in the playlist (this can also occur if SJGPlay is exited then 
re-started while the CD is still playing). If "auto play" is enabled the CD 
will start to play automatically when the unit is switched. A list of 
available drive units is displayed on the help screen.

  If you have an NEC MultiSpin CD Changer configured as a single drive letter 
you can select the tray by pressing 0 first, then ALT plus the tray number. 
For example: 0, ALT-2  to select tray 2. 

  Note: The MCDTRAY program shipped with the NEC changer must be in your
  ~~~~~ path for tray selection to work!
  
        Since the drive is assigned a single letter, it is treated as one 
        drive. The "DRV" Repeat Mode does NOT work as expected (it does NOT 
        switch trays)! If you can spare the extra letters you should
        configure the unit as multiple drives.

  To completely reset the current CD-ROM drive press the "~" key. This will
stop playback and re-read the CD.

  To control the volume use the "[" and "]" keys to decrease or increase the
level from 0 to 99. To activate an automatic fade press ALT-[ or ] once. The
ALT-[ will memorize the current volume level then slowly fade the volume to
zero. Pressing ALT-] will slowly restore the volume to the previous level. Use
the "=" key to mute the volume. Pressing "=" again will restore volume to the
previous level. Use the configuration screen to select which DEVICE is
controlled by the volume keys. You can select the volume via the SoundBlaster
(or compatible) card's CD input level or master output level.

  To activate the SoundBlaser Pro/16 Mixer press ALT-S. Use the UP/DOWN keys
to select the Level control to change then LEFT/RIGHT to adjust it. The Treble
and Bass controls only work if you have a SB16.

  To eject the CD press "X". If your CD-ROM is a tray-type (as opposed to
the caddy-type), pressing "X" again will close the tray door. If "auto play"
is enabled the CD will start to play automatically when it is inserted.

  To exit the program press the "Q" key or ALT-X. If you use "Q" you will be
asked to confirm by pressing "Y" for yes or "N" for no. If you press ALT-X the
program will exit without confirmation. When the program exits the CD may stop
or may be ejected depending on the settings in the configuration screen.


PRINTING INFORMATION
====================

  Pressing the "?" key prints information for the specific mode as follows:

    MODE           PRINT WHAT?
    ----           -----------
    F1/F2 Tracks   CD Info (track titles and times).
    F3/F4 Lyrics   Lyrics for CURRENT track.
    F11   Catalog  Currently displayed catalog (CD's/Lyrics/Albums/All) 
                   printed in the currently sorted order.
    All Others     None

  You will be asked to confirm printing by pressing "Y" or "N". Make sure
your printer is ready before pressing "Y"!


DELETING INFORMATION
====================

  Pressing the DEL key deletes information for the specific mode as follows:

    MODE           DELETE WHAT?
    ----           ------------
    F1    Tracks   Programmed step at marker
    F2    CDInfo   CD Info files and ALL lyric files for CURRENT CD

                   Albums: Selected album file
    All Others     None


EDITING INFORMATION
===================

  Pressing "E" lets you edit information for the specific mode as follows:

    MODE         EDIT WHAT?                          SEE ALSO (section)
    ----         ----------                          ------------------

EDITING KEYS
============

  When you press "E" (while in modes F2, F3, F5 or F6) you enter EDIT mode
where you may enter information into a field or fields. The background
under the edit field will turn blue, and the following keys will be active:

    LEFT/RIGHT ......Move cursor Left/Right
    TAB .............Move cursor Right 8 characters
    DEL .............Delete character at cursor
    BACKSPACE .......Delete character to left of cursor
                     (if at the FIRST character it erases the ENTIRE field)
    INSERT ..........Toggle insert mode (Thick cursor=Insert, Thin=typeover)
    ESC .............Save and Exit edit mode
    ENTER ...........Save and Exit (single field), or
                     Go to next field (in a group of fields)
    UP/DOWN .........Select field to edit in a group of fields
    HOME/END ........Move to First/Last field in a group of fields
    PAGE UP/DOWN ....Page Up/Down in a group of fields

    CTRL-ENTER ......Split line at cursor (in a group of fields), or
                     Erase to end of line (single field)
    CTRL-LEFT .......Move to start of line
    CTRL-RIGHT.......Move to end of line
    CTRL-PAGEUP .....Memorize contents of entire field
    CTRL-PAGEDOWN ...Recall memorized field
    CTRL-HOME .......Erase entire field
    CTRL-END ........Restore original field contents
    CTRL-V ..........Insert memorized field at current cursor position

    ALT-U/L .........Convert entire field to Uppercase/Lowercase
    ALT-I/D .........Insert/Delete field (lower fields move up or down)
    ALT-T/B .........Mark Top/Bottom of block
    ALT-C ...........Copy marked block

Special Track control keys while in edit mode:

  These keys allow you to control playback of the current track, since the
normal cursor keys control cursor movement. These are handy when entering
lyrics so you don't need to keep re-playing the track over and over...
(These keys also work outside of edit mode).

    ALT-UP ..........Pause/Resume playback
    ALT-DOWN ........Re-start track
    ALT-LEFT/RIGHT...Reverse/Fastforward search

  You may enter lyrics using the built-in editor. This is a simple line-based
editor with NO text wrapping ability. See the "Editing Keys" section for a
detailed explanation of individual keys. This section covers the general
process of entering lyrics. If you have used an external editor to type the
lyrics see the "Utilities" section.

  Press the Lyrics key (F3) then press "E". This will edit lyrics for the
CURRENTLY SELECTED track.

  Editing the lyrics does NOT stop playback, however you may use the
"ALT-CURSOR" keys to control playback while editing. The ALT-UP key is 
particularly handy as it allows you to listen to a line then pause playback 
while you type it in. When you're ready for the next line press ALT-UP 
again. If you miss a line or need to re-play a line you can use ALT-LEFT to 
reverse a bit then ALT-RIGHT to catch up (or just let it play).

  Most songs have a chorus which is repeated one or more times during the
song. You can copy these lines using the BLOCK keys. Move to the first line 
of the chorus and press ALT-T to mark the top, then move to the last line and 
press ALT-B to mark the bottom of the block. The block will be highlighted in 
red. You can then move to the line where the chorus is repeated then press 
ALT-C to copy the marked lines. Lines remain marked so you can copy them as 
many times as are needed.

  If a certain line or phrase is repeated often, use CTRL-PGUP to memorize
that line then use CTRL-PGDN to recall it (entire line) or CTRL-V to insert
it into the current line (at the cursor position). 

  Feel free to leave some lines blank for clarity. Blank lines will not be
displayed in Karaoke mode. If you DO want to display a blank line, put a 
period (".") as the only character on the line.

  After you have typed in a rough version of the lyrics you might want to
use ALT-DOWN to re-start playback from the beginning while following along
with the lyrics using the cursor DOWN key. This will also let you get a
"feel" for the timing which will come in handy when you synchronize the 
lyrics later on (see next section).

  Try to enter all the lyrics for a song BEFORE you synchronize them. When
you insert lines (ALT-I) or copy lines (ALT-C) no synchronization data will
be available for those lines. This will cause lyric playback to stop, and you
will have to re-sync the entire track. Lines without sync information will
have a "." displayed at the beginning of the line. If you are editing a track
that has been synchronized, a green triangle will point to the currently 
playing line (the pointer changes ONLY when you move the cursor UP or DOWN!).

  To exit Lyrics entry press the ESC key. Lyrics will automatically be saved
with the appropriate filename (CD{idnum}.{tracknum} format).

  And one last thing: Don't trust the lyrics that may be included with the
CD... They're rarely correct or complete!


SYNCHRONIZING LYRICS
====================

  Select Karaoke mode (F4) then press "E" (edit). Playback will be stopped. 
You will be presented with a summary of keys that control synchronization.

  Select "I" for an Initial synchronization, or "F" to finetune the
synchronization. If you don't want to synchronize press the ESC key.

  You must have already entered some lyrics before you can synchronize them
and you must already have synchronized the lyrics before you can finetune
them (duh)! The initial synchronization process plays the track from start
to end and you do the entire track in a linear manner. Finetuning will loop
playback of the selected line so you can adjust when it starts. The current
line is indicated by a triangular yellow marker.

  Note: When you press "I" or "F" playback will begin, so be ready!

  Initial Synchronization Keys:
  -----------------------------

    SPACE ........Press SPACE at the moment the line is sung
    BACKSPACE ....Re-try the previous line. Playback will return to the
                  line before the previous line to give you a chance to
                  get ready for the line again
    ESC ..........Abort without saving

    Note: The timing information will automatically be saved when the last
    ~~~~~ line has been synchronized.

  Finetuning Keys:
  ----------------

    UP/DOWN ......Select line to adjust
    PAGE UP/DOWN .Select Previous or Next Page
    LEFT .........Start line earlier (5/75ths of a second)
    CTRL-LEFT ....Start line earlier (half a second)
    RIGHT ........Start line later   (5/75ths of a second)
    CTRL-RIGHT ...Start line later   (half a second)
    + or - .......Increase/Decrease loop time (20/75ths of a second)
    * ............Set loop to repeat to the start of the next line
    / ............Reset loop time (half the fastforward/reverse time)
    END ..........Exit and Save
    ESC ..........Abort without saving

  TIP: for blank lines, if possible, try to start them just AFTER the
  ~~~~ previous line ends so that the line can remain on the screen when in
       Karaoke mode. If there is a long delay before the next line is sung
       wait on the blank line until just a few seconds before it starts.
        

PROGRAMMING
===========

  Press the Playlist key (F1). To toggle program mode press "G". Use the
CURSOR keys to move the yellow marker above the track numbers. The name of
the track under the marker will be displayed at the bottom of the display
window. You can press DEL or BACKSPACE to delete steps from the playlist. To
add a track, enter a two-digit number such as "03" or "14". The track will be
INSERTED at the marker position. Only valid track numbers and "00" will be
accepted. Entering "00" will insert a pause in the playlist (you must press 
"P" to continue playback).

  IMPORTANT NOTE!:  When program mode is ENABLED, entering a two-digit track
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  number inserts it into the program playlist regardless of
                    the display mode! It does NOT play the track.

  You can clear all tracks by pressing "C". Pressing it again will select all
tracks in track-number order. Shuffle (jumble) tracks with the "J" key.
The "^" (shift 6) key will program only those tracks that have lyrics.

  If you want to dub the CD to tape use the "%" (shift 5) key. You will be 
asked for the length (in minutes) of ONE side of the tape. Pauses will be
inserted at the correct location(s) so that songs are not cut off and you 
have time to flip the tape over or change tapes. You must press P to start
playback after the CD pauses.

  The currently playing track will be highlighted in red. If you delete a
track that is playing, the next track (if any) will be played. To save
programmed tracks press the "W" key. The program will be saved in the same
file that is used for CD information ("CD{idnum}.CD") so that each CD can
have it's own favourite track programming. If you want to re-load the program 
saved in this file press "L". If you don't want programmed tracks for the
current CD press "C" to clear the program then "W" to write it to the file.

  When "use programmed playlist if available" is enabled the programmed
tracks will automatically be loaded and enabled when the CD is next inserted.


CATALOG (database)
=======

  There are four different catalogs modes:

    CD's   (.CD ) -- Displays CD titles
    Lyrics (.T??) -- Displays individual Lyric files
    Albums (.ALB) -- Displays Album files containing lyrics for an entire CD
    All    (.*  ) -- Displays All files*

      * Note: The program currently ignores .BMP files, which are Album Cover
              bitmaps for use with SJGPlay for Windows (in development).
  
  Press F11 for the catalog. This will read each CD{idnum} file and extract
the appropriate title from the first line, then display a list on the screen. 
To cycle between CDs, Lyrics, Album, or All files press the "\" key. Use the 
CURSOR keys (UP/DOWN/PgUp/PgDn/HOME/END) to scroll through the list. A yellow 
triangle marker at the top of the list shows the currently selected line. 
Press the INS key to sort the catalog by number (disk order), ID (time), or 
title. The yellow marker will point to the sorted column.

  When displaying the ALL catalog, album titles will be displayed as normal
and song titles will be displayed with "__" preceeding them. When you sort by 
filename this will let you see the CD title followed by the corresponding 
lyrics files for that CD.

  To delete the currently selected file press the DEL key. To edit the file 
press the "E" key. This will shell to the DOS EDIT command (see your DOS 
manual. Press ALT-F then X to return to SJGPlay). 

  Notes: The EDIT command must be in your path for the "E" command to work.
  ~~~~~~ When in the DOS editor all CD control is lost. Be careful when
         editing lyrics with synchronization numbers!

         The program can not store both lyrics and catalog entries at the 
         same time. Switching to either lyric mode will require the catalog 
         to be re-loaded and vice-versa.
  
  Press "W" to write the current catalog (in the current order) to a text 
file called CATALOG.TXT. This could be used for importing to a word processor 
or just for a quick reference when not running SJGPlay.


UTILITIES
=========

  Pressing the "U" or F12 keys will display the Utilities Help screen plus a
CD Frame Accuracy number (in 1/75th's of a second). All utilities work at any 
time, not just when the utility screen is displayed. The utility screen is 
just a reference to help you remember the key commands.

  Key Description
  --- -----------

  D   Set Display Timer
  O   Display Elapsed Timer screen
  Y   Set/Clear Elapsed Timer
  Z   Set Event/Countdown Timer


Renaming Lyrics:

  The following functions are useful when you have used a text editor to edit
lyrics or have obtained a text file containing lyrics from another source.
There are FTP/WWW sites containing song lyrics. Some files may contain lyrics 
for many songs all in a single file (referred to as an "Album" file).

  The "!" and "@" keys will rename all files to the proper format. If you're
not running the program and don't know the {idnum} of a specific CD, you can
substitute "CD000000" or a {name} of your own choosing while creating the
files. When the CD is inserted and the proper {idnum} is known they can be
renamed. Only the first part of the filename will be renamed! Files must
still end in the proper format (.CD for information files or .T01, .T02 etc
for lyric files) The "@" key will prompt you for the {name} of the files.

  So, for example, if you typed out the lyrics for tracks one and two from
the CD "Ace of Base - The Sign" and called them "thesign.t01" and
"thesign.t02" you would press "@" then enter "thesign" when prompted for the
{name}. This would then rename the files to "CD206107.T01" and "CD206107.T02"
since the {idnum} for that CD is 206107. The {idnum} for the current CD is
displayed on the help screen if you want to know what it is. You can also
type: SJGPLAY INFO on the command line.

Album Files: (Extracting/Exporting)

  The "#" key will extract lyrics from an "Album" file containing many songs.
Each song in the file must begin with the text "@SONG:" followed by the song
name. The program will extract all lines after that line, up until another
"@SONG" line is reached (or if all lines are filled).

  You will be prompted to enter the complete path of the "Album" file and the
name of the song to extract. The name of the song must exactly BEGIN with
what is entered, however it is not case-sensitive. If you enter an incomplete
song name, the first song matching that will be extracted. For example, if
you enter "do i" as the song name, it would extract "Do I Love You" or
"Do I Care", whichever came first in the "Album" file.

  If the Song is not found, a list of song names will be displayed. This
information is held temporarily as lyrics and will disappear if the display
mode or track is changed.

Make an Album file:

  The "$" key will create an Album file for the current CD. You will be asked
for an optional comment and if you'd like to delete the individual lyric
files. Only answer YES if you've entered all the lyrics and syncronized them
and you're happy with them. Once an album file is created the program will
automatically extract individual lyrics from the album file when needed, so
individual lyric files are not strictly nessessary (although once they are
deleted you won't be able to list the song names in the lyric catalog). Album
files take up less hard drive space than individual lyric files.

  Important: The make album function REQUIRES individual lyric files. Don't 
  ~~~~~~~~~~ try to make another album file once you've deleted the 
             individual files... You will loose all the lyrics! (You WILL be 
             warned!) To re-create individual lyric files, press F3 then edit 
             EACH track (IE: E, ESC, +, E, ESC, + etc...). 

Importing (copy):

  The "&" key will copy a lyric file into the data directory with the proper
filename. If the file is not in the current directory you must enter the 
complete path along with the filename. It will be copied to the data 
directory with the proper CD{idnum}.{tracknum} filename.

Exporting (save as):

  The "*" key will save the current lyrics to a file with a name of your
choice. You will be prompted to enter the filename. This is useful for songs
that appear on more than one CD in your collection. Just give the file the
appropriate file name (in the format CD{idnum}.{tracknum}) for the other CD.
Or, you can give it any name (be sure to end the name with the proper track
number ie: T02) then when you insert the other CD, go to the proper track and
use the "@" key to rename it.

ZIP file Extract/Add:

  The "(" and ")" keys extract or add the info files for the current CD to or
from the SAMPLES.ZIP file. You can use these functions to:

  1. Pull the info from the supplied SAMPLES.ZIP file without having to
     extract all the files from *MY* CD collection.
  2. Share data files with friends by ZIPPING the data from your CD
     collection then sending them the SAMPLES.ZIP file rather than all the
     individual files.

  You will be asked to confirm that you want to continue. The SAMPLES.ZIP
  file and all info files MUST be in the current directory! The SJGPLAY 
  environment variable is ignored.
  
  Note: For these functions to work you must have PKUNZIP.EXE and PKZIP.EXE 
  ~~~~~ in your DOS path.


TIMER FUNCTIONS
===============

Event Timer:
  
  Press "Z" to set the Event. There are two modes: 
  
    1. Time of day - Enter the time in the form "HH:MM:SS" (eg: 12:00:00).
    2. Countdown   - Enter the number of seconds in the form "-SS" (eg: -30).
  
  When the time of day reaches the specified time or the countdown reaches
zero the event is performed. You can set any or all of the following:

    Message........Display message in big letters (leave blank to skip)
    Track Control..Track#=Play track, 0=No change, -1=Stop
    Display Mode...Set display mode (0=No change)

The time must be specified to the exact second. If a message is entered it
will be displayed for either 5 seconds (for time-of day) or 1 second (for 
countdown). The event time is cleared after each event.

Elapsed Timer:

  Press "O" to display the Elapsed Timer screen. This screen shows elapsed
time in minutes and seconds. To start the timer press "Y". To clear the timer
press "Y" a second time.

Display Mode Timer:

  Press "D" to set the Display Mode Timer. After a specified time interval 
the display mode will rotate to the next mode in the mode list. Each display 
mode is a single digit or character. Do not enter spaces in the mode list.

  Modes 1 to 9 correspond to function keys F1 to F9. Mode "A", "B" and "C" 
correspond to F10, F11 and F12 respectively. So, for example, entering
"1257" as the mode list would rotate between Playlist, CD Info, Title, and
Frequency bars.

  To cancel Display Mode rotation enter "0" as the time interval or select a
display mode via one of the function keys.


OTHER FUNCTIONS
===============

  To load an alternate message file press ALT-M. You will be asked to confirm 
by pressing Y or N. If you press "Y" the file SJGPLAY.MSG will be loaded. If 
you press "N" the default messages will be restored. The message file could 
be used to translate the display to a different language, or just to change 
the wording of some of the text (not all at this point). E-Mail me if you are 
interested in translating the messages to another language.

  To activate the font editor press ALT-E. Follow the onscreen instructions. 
The cursor keys and function keys work differently, however all other keys 
still control the program. With the mouse, clicking inside the current
character moves the block pointer and clicking in the ASCII table sets the 
block (same as PgUp). Use the TAB or M keys to exit (Make sure you save 
the font before exiting!). Note: The font editor can not create a new font
from scratch or add characters to an existing font. See the EXTRAS.DOC file
for more information.

  To load an alternate big-character font press ALT-F. You will be asked to
confirm by pressing Y or N. If you press "Y" the file SJGPLAY.FNT will be 
loaded. If you press "N" the default font will be restored.

  To activate the calculator press ALT-C. All keys are ignored except the
numbers, operations keys (+-*/=), and backspace. To exit press ESC.

  To see the calendar press ALT-D. The cursor keys control the month and
year. HOME takes you to the current month. All other keys work as normal.

 To set the screen blanker press ALT-B. Each press will add 2 minutes to the
blank time (maximum 30). If no keys are pressed after the specified time the
screen will blank and the track number and elapsed time will appear randomly
across the screen. When the screen is blanked pressing any key (including the
shift or control keys) will restore the display (the key you pressed is
ignored by the rest of the program so you won't activate some unknown
function by mistake).

  To deactivate screen blanking press ALT-B until it shows a blank time of 0.


ERROR CONDITIONS
================

  If an error occurs in the program (if you enter an illegal character in a
filename, or the printer is off, for example) the program will print an error
message and, depending on the type of error, give you the opportunity to
either: Retry, Cancel, or Abort the program. Choose "Retry" if the problem is 
something you can fix (ie: turning the printer online or feeding paper).
Choose "Cancel" if it's something you can't fix (ie: don't have a printer)
and the program will cancel the operation. Choose "Abort" if "Retry"
keeps giving you the same error and "Cancel" won't work either (probably my
programming error...).


COMMAND-LINE ARGUMENTS
======================

  SJGPlay can be controlled through command-line arguments. These may be used
to modify how the program is run or can be used to control CD functions from
the command line (or via a batch file) without actually interacting with the
program. Program-mode options must appear on the command line by themselves.
Control-mode options may be listed with spaces separating each one, and will 
be executed in the order they appear.

  Program-mode arguments:
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    CHECK..........Checks if a CD is in the drive. If there is no CD in the
                   drive the program will exit. If there is a CD in the drive
                   the program will run normally. This can be used in your
                   AUTOEXEC.BAT file so that you can play CD's when the
                   computer boots up.

    CONFIG:file....Specifies a secondary configuration file. Settings in
                   this file override those set in the default config file
                   (which is read first). You can use a text editor to create 
                   the file (or edit the default configuration) to include 
                   only those setting you want to change. The file may also 
                   include a "PATH=" statement to change the data path from 
                   the default set via the SJGPLAY environment variable.
  
  Control-mode arguments:
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    NOTE: The following arguments can be shortened to the first 4 characters.
          Where you see 'nn' substitute a number as indicated.
          
    Device control:

    UNIT:nn ...Select drive unit# nn (1=first drive, 2=second drive etc)
    EJECT .....Eject any type of CD
    NODATA ....Eject CD-ROM's only
    NOAUDIO ...Eject Audio CD's only
    VOLUME:nn .Set Volume to nn (0 to 99)

    Playback:  (to play a random track set nn to -1!)

    PLAY:nn ...Play track nn (plays current track if nn not specified)
    SINGLE:nn .Single-play track nn (stops at end of track)
    NEXT ......Play next track
    PREVIOUS ..Play previous track
    STOP ......Stop CD playback
    WAIT ......Waits for CD to stop, track to end, or keypress

    Information:

    INFO.......Display CD info including track titles and time, total time
    TRACK......Display track name and number
    TNUMBER....Display track number only
    ELAPSED....Display track elapsed time
    TITLE......Display CD title
    
    Conditionals:

    The following arguments can be used to stop command line parsing if the
    specified condition is false, or continue if the condition is true:

    IFSTOPPED..If the CD is stopped then continue parsing CMDLIST
    IFPLAYING..If the CD is playing then continue parsing CMDLIST
    IFAUDIO ...If the CD is an Audio CD (more than 1 track) then continue
    IFCD.......If a CD is inserted then continue parsing CMDLIST,
               If not, then exit with ERRORLEVEL=1 (useful in batch files)

       (if the condition is false then the remaining arguments on the
        command-line are ignored)
 
    Special command:

    NOEXIT.....Stops the program from exiting after processing CMDLIST
               (ie: continue on to standard user-interface. Any commands
               after NOEXIT will be ignored)

  When in command-line mode, commands are executed in order, and control is
  returned to the DOS prompt (or calling program) unless NOEXIT is specified.

    Also, holding either of the SHIFT keys during command-line processing 
  will simulate the NOEXIT command. This could be used in the AUTOEXEC.BAT to 
  jump right into the program when the SHIFT key is held down during booting.

  Some examples:

  SJGPLAY CHECK ....................Run the program if a CD is in the drive
  SJGPLAY INFO .....................Display name, track titles of current CD
  SJGPLAY IFAUDIO PLAY:1 ...........If an audio disc is inserted then play
                                    track 1 (put this in your AUTOEXEC!)
  SJGPLAY IFSTOPPED PLAY:5 .........Play track 5 if the CD is NOT playing
  SJGPLAY UNIT:1 STOP UNIT:2 PLAY ..Stop CD in unit 1 then start playing the
                                    current track of unit 2
  SJGPLAY NOAUDIO ..................Eject the CD if it is an audio CD.
                                    (maybe your system gets confused if an
                                     audio disc is inserted?)
  SJGPLAY CONFIG:C:\MYCONFIG.CFG ...Specify a secondary config file called
                                    "myconfig.cfg" located in the root
                                    directory of drive C:
  SJGPLAY VOLU:99 PLAY:-1 NOEX .....Set full volume, play a random track,
                                    then go to user interface
  SJGPLAY WAIT EJECT ...............Wait for track to finish, then eject CD

The following batch file demonstrates how to test for the presence of a CD 
then repeatedly play random tracks:

  @ECHO OFF
  SJGPLAY IFCD
  IF ERRORLEVEL==1 goto NOCD
  
  :LOOP
  CLS
  ECHO RANDOM TRACK PLAY (Press CTRL-BREAK to abort!)
  ECHO                   (Press SPACE for next track)
  SJGPLAY TITLE SINGLE:-1 WAIT
  GOTO LOOP
  
  :NOCD
  ECHO Please put a CD in the drive!

KNOWN BUGS AND MISSING FEATURES
===============================

  I've tried to test the program as thoroughly as possible, however bugs can
still occur. As stated at the beginning, I can't test every possible
combination of equipment, so your milage may vary... Anyway, here are a few
of the bugs I haven't been able to squash (yet!):

    - Command-line option "NODATA" to eject cd-roms not working - all cd's
      appear to be audio to the DSE library's "IsData%" function.
    - the cursor sometimes jumps one character to the right when editing.


IDEAS FOR FUTURE VERSIONS
=========================

  Since I've started work on a Windows version I'm no longer concentrating on
the DOS version. That doesn't mean I'm abandoning it, however I can't say
if/when I will be doing any more major development on SJGPlay for DOS....

In any case...

  The next MAJOR release should support Word-by-Word lyrics playback similar 
to what you would see with an actual KARAOKE CD...

  Some of the other things I'm considering for future versions of the program
(in no particular order):

    - ability to include comments with each CD or Lyric file
    - more cataloging information like music category (rock, pop, etc)
    - programming across multiple drive units.
    - searching (find song titles or lyrics)

  If you want to see any of these added, have ideas of your own, or have a
comment, send me a message via e-mail. I can't promise you I'll add them but 
I will consider all reasonable requests.

  If you have assembly source code for a REAL spectrum analyzer which you'd 
like to donate (that could be integrated into Microsoft's Basic PDS 7.1),
please e-mail me.

  Thank-you for trying SJGPlay!

END.
