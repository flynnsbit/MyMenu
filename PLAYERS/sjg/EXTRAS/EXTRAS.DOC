SJGPLAY - "Extras" Documentation -- Dec 1/96           (C)1996 Steve J. Gray
=======

The files in the EXTRAS.ZIP include the following:

  SJGPLAY.MSG  - Alternate program messages.
  SJGPLAY.FNT  - Sample alternate big-character font (uses SJGFNT8/16.COM) 
  *.FNT        - More sample fonts
  SJGFNT8.COM  - Program to load an 8-pixel tall font into the video card
  SJGFNT16.COM - Program to load a 16-pixel tall font into the video card
  FONTEX.EXE   - Font exporter utility - exports font from video card
  

IMPORTANT!
----------

  SJGPlay version 1.29 automatically loads SJGPLAY.MSG and/or SJGPLAY.FNT
if they exist in the directory where SJGPLAY.EXE is run from (the CURRENT
directory, NOT the path specified by the SJGPLAY environment variable).
If you do not want them to load each time, you must either; delete them,
rename them, or move them to a different directory!


SJGPLAY.MSG
-----------
  This file contains messages that replace SOME of the internal messages. 
The HELP, SYNC-HELP, UTILITIES and some other screens are NOT changed.

  Each line in the file is a separate message. You can modify the included 
file but be sure not to add or delete lines. Some messages can be of any 
(reasonable) length, however some must be a specific length. Making a string 
too long or too short may affect the screen display!

There are different types of messages: 

 1. Display-only (regular strings or titles)
 2. Display with special command characters (color changes, eg $#@!)
 3. Group Messages (Must not change the spacing or length!)
 4. Control strings (keyboard scan codes, eg: @77)
 5. Program strings (shell commands, eg pkzip)


SJGFNT8.COM and SJGFNT16.COM
----------------------------
  These two files (executable programs) are designed to load and activate
an alternate character set for your VGA card. The character sets have been
modified by me to include a better selection of "block" characters to give
you more flexibility in designing your fonts. The normal character set only
has half-block characters. I have created "quarter-block" characters
(ie: divide one character into 4 sections and have every possible combination
of those 4 sections lit). The "8" file is for 50-line VGA mode and the "16"
is for 25-line vga mode.

  These two files were created by a program called FONTEDIT from PC Magazine,
included with the book "BASIC LAB NOTES" (ZIFF-DAVIS PRESS).


FONTEX.EXE
----------
  This program reads the font from your VGA card and exports it to a format
that SJGPlay understands. At the moment the most useful font to export is the
8-line font using either (H)alf-block or (E)dited (SJGFNTx.com as above) mode
using 5 export lines. When exporting the proper ASCII range is 32 to 126.

 If you want to view the entire font you can export characters 0 to 255 in
(N)ormal mode, with the same number of export lines as the font (8/14/16).

 To have a font load automatically when SJGPlay starts you must save it with
the name "SJGPLAY.FNT".


SJGPLAY FONT FORMAT
-------------------

  SJGPlay fonts are big letters and numbers that are made up of a matrix of
normal (built into the video card) or external (modified and loaded) characters.
The built-in SJGPlay font contains characters from ASCII 32 ("space") to
ASCII 126 (the ~ character). Loaded fonts may contain as many as needed up to
ASCII 255.

  The first line of the file must contain the following information:

     HEIGHT, CHRS, FILE1, FILE2

  where;
     HEIGHT...is the number of lines in the font (usually 5)
     CHRS.....is the number of characters in the font (usually 95)
     FILE1....is an external VGA font com file for 25-line video screens
     FILE2....is an external VGA font com file for 43 or 50-line video screens

  examples;
     5, 95, "", ""
     5, 224, sjgfnt16.com, sjgfnt8.com

     * If you specify an empty (ie "") FILE1 or FILE2 the normal character set
       will be used.

  The remaining lines are the actual font data.

  The standard font is 5 lines tall. Currently SJGPlay is optimized to work with
fonts that are 5 lines high, however font sizes up to 16 are supported (To make
the time and track display look correct the numerical characters should be
limited to 4 lines high by 5 characters wide).

  Each character must have the exact number of strings specified by HEIGHT and
each MUST be enclosed with QUOTES to ensure spaces within each character are
not ignored! The font can be proportional (each character can be a different
width). The first string of each character determines the width of the
character. The last 4 strings will be padded or truncated if nessessary to
this width!

Example:

The letter "V" could be entered like this:

"*   * "   <-- The fist line is 6 characters wide
"*   * "   <-- Each entry on a separate line
" * *  "   <-- Notice the last 4 lines have trailing spaces included,
"  *   "   <--   however they are not required
"      "   <-- The last line is usually for lowercase descenders)

Or, all on one line, and no trailing spaces, except for the first line, 
like this:

"*   * ","*   *"," * *","  *",""  

  Make sure there are NO blank lines in the file! You can include comment
lines anywhere AFTER the first line provided the line BEGINS with a
semicolon (";").

  Most likely you will be using the upper 128 ASCII characters (like the 
block or half-block characters or the line characters) to make up one big 
character, so you will need an editor that will allow you to enter them in 
properly (the MS-DOS EDIT command works for most characters) and to save it
as a "text" file (no special formatting codes). Of course, the built-in font
editor in SJGPlay can also be used...

Note: the internal SJGPlay font editor can only edit an existing font. It
      can NOT create new fonts or add extra characters to a font. To create
      an extended font use the FONTEX program or add the appropriate entries
      to the end of a normal font and adjust the first line as needed (ie:
      create "HEIGHT" lines for each character you want to add then increase
      the number of characters specified on line 1 of the font file).


FINAL NOTE
----------

  If you design some really nice fonts, or you translate the messages to
another language, please send them to me so I can include them in future
releases of the program. Thanks!
