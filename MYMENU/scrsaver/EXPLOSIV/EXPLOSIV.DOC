		PART 1        BASICS AND INSTALLATION



Chapter 1)        ABOUT EXPLOSIV


Explosiv is a DOS and Windows screen saver that offers a safe reliable
means of preventing monitor burn-in with a library of several exciting
and imaginative displays.  Unique fractal modules can run hours
without any repetition in the displayed pattern.  In addition,
Explosiv can dynamically create new displays from color images or
using typed in messages.  Among its many features, Explosiv includes:

 - A DOS and Windows screen saver with 16 displays
 - The ability to take GIF files and turn them into Explosiv displays
   ( EGA and VGA only ).  The shareware version only supports 16 colors.
 - Turn any DOS program into a Windows screen saver.
 - Add, change or delete displays from Explosiv.
 - A source code template for writing your own displays.



Chapter 2)        GETTING STARTED


  Before Installing Explosiv

Check that your computer satisfies the minimum software and hardware
recommendations listed below:

    Explosiv for DOS

	- DOS 3.1 or later
	- VGA, EGA, MCGA, CGA, HERC or MDA monitor
	- Mouse ( optional )
	- Hard Disk ( optional )

    Explosiv for Windows

	- 386 processor
	- Windows 3.0 or later
	- A Windows compatible mouse
	 - color VGA video card ( optional )

If your computer does not satisfy all of the above then this does not
necessarily mean that Explosiv will not work on your system, many
aspects may still work.  Specifically, if you have NOT installed
Windows on your computer then you will not be able to access Explosiv
for Windows even though the DOS version will work fine. 

Also, make sure that you are familiar with the basic workings of your
computer operating system.  In particular, PART 3 assumes that you are
acquainted with Microsoft Windows. 


  Installing Explosiv

To install the software follow these steps:

1. Turn on your computer and insert the Explosiv diskette.  If you are
installing Explosiv from more than one disk then insert disk one and
replace diskettes when prompted.  For simplicity, assume that the
software is being installed from drive A.  From this drive run the
Explosiv Install program:

	A:\> install

2. Install asks whether it is being run from a DOS session in Windows.
Explosiv cannot be installed properly from Windows.  You must
terminate Install, exit Windows and restart the installation.  If you
are not running Windows select YES to continue ( i.e., click on YES ). 

3. If you are running version 2.0 of Explosiv then it is important
that you delete any copies of Explosiv.com that may in your path.
Install searches for this file and prompts to see whether it should
erase this file or not.  If you select NO then you should make sure
that you delete the file manually. 

4. If you are running version 3.0 or greater of Explosiv then you may
not wish to upgrade to the latest version of Explosiv for DOS. If you
do upgrade then this will overwrite the Explosiv for DOS display
library, you will lose any new displays you have made or any changes
you have made to the library. 

5. For optimal performance, Explosiv should be copied onto a hard
drive.  The default directory that Explosiv will be installed to is
C:\EXPLOSIV.  At the prompt select INSTALL if the default is okay.  If
you wish to install Explosiv in another directory enter the new name
then click INSTALL. 

6. To properly access Explosiv for DOS from any directory on your
computer you should copy the file explosiv.bat to your path.  Install
offers to copy this file to your path for you.  Install will display a
list of path directories, select the one you wish to copy explosiv.bat
to or select CANCEL to bypass this feature. 

7. Explosiv for DOS may be run automatically whenever you boot your
computer by appending the line:

	C:\EXPLOSIV\EXPLOSIV -

at the end of your autoexec.bat.  Install will optionally do this for
you if you wish.  If you select YES then Install will scan the
contents of your autoexec.bat to see if Explosiv is already being run
from start-up.  If not, a call to Explosiv is appended to the end of
the file. 

8. Explosiv for Windows may be run automatically whenever you start
Windows by including the line

	LOAD=C:\EXPLOSIV\WX.EXE

in your win.ini file.  Install will optionally do this for you if you
wish, select YES at Install s prompt. 

9.  Install will start Windows so that it may create the Program
Manager icons.  Once done, installation will be complete.  To run
Explosiv for DOS type:

	C:\> EXPLOSIV

and to run Explosiv for Windows run:

	C:\EXPLOSIV> win WX.EXE


  Manually Installing Explosiv

You may prefer to install Explosiv manually instead of using the
Install program.  In this case, you must create the directory
C:\EXPLOSIV, copy the Explosiv files to this directory, copy knife.vbx
to your Windows system directory ( Explosiv Deluxe only ), modify
autoexec.bat and win.ini to start Explosiv automatically, and finally,
run win wxinst to create the Explosiv icons in the Program Manager. 


  Possible Problems

If for any reason Explosiv fails to run when you boot your computer
you should check the autoexec.bat file to make sure that the EXPLOSIV
line was correctly appended and that you are not running a menu system
or .bat file without the CALL prefix before you run Explosiv.  If you
are, you must manually edit the start-up file to ensure that Explosiv
is being run ( for example, move the Explosiv line higher up in the
file ). 

Other possible errors may occur if your distribution files are
incomplete ( check readme for details ), if the Program Manager could
not be updated, or if knife.vbx could not be copied into your Windows
system directory ( Explosiv Deluxe only ). 



Chapter 3)        EXPLOSIV SUMMARY


This chapter gives a brief summary of the operation of the Explosiv
Screen Saver.  It is advised that you familiarize yourself with the
contents of this chapter before using Explosiv so that you can make
the best use of the screen saver.  The information given here is
described in more detail in the remaining sections of this manual. 


  Installing Explosiv for DOS

You may either run Explosiv as a memory resident screen saver or
simply demo the displays through the full screen interface.  To have
Explosiv become resident run the command:

	C:\> EXPLOSIV -

When the program is resident you may activate it immediately by
pressing Ctrl-Alt-Shift, disable it using Ctrl-Alt-E and re-enable it
using Ctrl-Alt-B. 

Once in memory the program may be manipulated in many ways.  Most
importantly are the commands:

	C:\> EXPLOSIV REMOVE	- Remove Explosiv from memory
	C:\> EXPLOSIV OFF	- Deactivate Explosiv
	C:\> EXPLOSIV ON	- Activate Explosiv


  Running Explosiv for DOS

To run the full screen interface simply enter "EXPLOSIV" at the
command line with no arguments.  The program will list the available
displays and their individual settings.  To demo a display move the
cursor to the display name and press ENTER or click on the name with
the mouse. Once you have set Explosiv to the desired configuration
exit the program.  The program gives two options for doing this,
either exit normally or stay resident ( that is, become a screen
saver ). 


  Installing Explosiv For Windows

To run Explosiv for Windows click on the Explosiv icon in the Program
Manager.  The icon should appear at the bottom of the screen.  If you
move the mouse to the top left corner of the screen Explosiv will
activate immediately. 


  Configuring Explosiv For Windows

To configure the program, double click on the icon name ( while it is
running ) and select Setup Explosiv .  Choose the settings that you
prefer and click OKAY.  If you select the Multipak display then
Explosiv will allow you to select those displays that you wish the
screen saver to cycle through. 


  About Explosiv Deluxe

If you have purchased Explosiv Deluxe then Explosiv also includes a
complete Windows image processing program.  View a variety of image
formats, do image conversions, set your Windows background or make an
image into a Windows screen saver with this program. 



		PART 2        EXPLOSIV FOR DOS



Chapter 4)        USING EXPLOSIV FOR DOS


The DOS version of Explosiv is a Terminate and Stay Resident (TSR)
program that loads into memory when you like ( for example,
automatically at boot up time ) and stays out of your way until you
want it to become active. Occupying from 1 to 47 KB of memory, the DOS
version of Explosiv ( which can be loaded above the 640KB limit ) renders
several beautifully animated displays. In fact, if you prefer, you can
invoke the full screen user interface and just point and click on the
displays you want to see. Just sit back and watch the show! 


  Running Explosiv

To invoke the DOS version of Explosiv simply go to the DOS command
line prompt and type:

	C:\> EXPLOSIV

and the full screen interface will appear.  Alternatively, Explosiv
accepts a full range of command line options ( which are discussed in
detail in the appendix ).  For example, to install Explosiv as a
memory resident screen saver, simply enter:

	C:\> EXPLOSIV -

The above command would also be the recommended way of running
Explosiv directly from your autoexec.bat file on bootup.  Once
resident the screen saver will start a display if you are in text mode
and blank the screen if you are in a graphics mode. 


  Running Displays Using The Hotkey

To activate Explosiv immediately without waiting press and release the
Ctrl-Alt-Shift keys combination at the same time.  The display can
then be deactivated by pressing any key or by clicking on the mouse
button. Note that some programs grab the keyboard in such a way that
Explosiv does not detect key presses, in many cases pressing the mouse
button will still work to deactivate Explosiv and return you to your
work. 


  Disabling and Enabling Explosiv

If you want to temporarily turn the screen saver off you can press
Ctrl-Alt-E ( and then Ctrl-Alt-B to turn the screen saver on again ).
You can also run EXPLOSIV OFF on the command line to turn the screen
saver off and EXPLOSIV ON to turn the screen saver on.  You can set
this up in a batch file if you want to automatically disable Explosiv
while you are running a particular program.  The hot keys listed above
can also be changed ( see the next chapter for details ). 


  Removing Explosiv From Memory

If you want to free Explosiv from memory you can type EXPLOSIV REMOVE.
This will remove Explosiv from memory if there are no other programs
loaded above it.  If it is not possible to remove Explosiv from memory
an error message will be printed and no action will be taken. 


  Running Explosiv s Interface

If you start Explosiv with no command line options a full screen
interface will appear.  From this environment you can demo displays,
change screen saver settings or even create new displays.  For the
interface to work properly it is important that the three files
EXPLOSIV.COM, EXPLOSIV.EXE and EXPLOSIV.OVL are stored in the same
directory.  To use Explosiv, either copy these three files to your
path or put a separate copy of EXPLOSIV.COM in your path and set the
environment variable EXPLOSIV to the directory name of the three
files.  For example, you can copy the three screen saver files to the
directory C:\EXPLOSIV then put EXPLOSIV.COM in your path and run the
command

	SET EXPLOSIV=C:\EXPLOSIV.

When the interface starts you will see several windows. Note that the
active window will appear with a highlighted title.  To make another
window active you can either press the TAB key, the Shift-TAB key or
simply click the mouse cursor on the window you wish to activate.
Most active windows will also have a cursor within the window. This
cursor can be moved with the up or down cursor keys or by clicking the
unselected item with the mouse.  If the selected item has a value
associated with it ( for example, the number in the minutes field )
then this can be changed by using the right and left cursor keys or
by clicking on the selected item. 


  On-Line Help

You can see on-line help for any window by pressing the F1 key, a box
will appear describing the window s function and disappear again when
you press any key. 


  Key Bindings

If you press F10 ( or ESC ) a popup window will appear with a list of
options.  You can activate any option by pressing the first letter in
the description or by clicking on the entry with the mouse. The popup
window is divided into two parts, the top part lists the screens that
can be viewed - from Image Maker to Display Librarian - while the
bottom part lists alternate methods of exiting the interface. 


  Quitting The Interface

If you want to quit the interface without Explosiv becoming resident
then press ESC E. If you want Explosiv to become a screen saver press
ESC Q. To remove a resident copy of Explosiv from memory press ESC R.
Finally, to abort all changes made, press Ctrl-C at any time in the
Explosiv interface. 


  Viewing Displays

When the Explosiv interface initially starts the DISPLAYS window will
be active; by moving the cursor to the desired display name you can
select a new module.  To demo the display from within the interface
simply press ENTER or click on the selected entry.  Each entry will
have its own values of color, delay or objects.


  Color And Minutes

The color of the display will have one of three values, Mono will
force the display into monochrome mode, Color will force color
patterns and Tinge gives an alternate color pattern.  Although setting
the latter does not affect very many displays it does give different
patterns for Aranea, Fireworks and Serinde.  Once Explosiv is
resident, the minutes field indicates the number of minutes of
inactivity the screen saver should wait before it starts the selected
display.  This can be set to as little as one minute or to as much as
one half hour. 


  Delay Factor And Objects

The delay is a number from 1 to 255 which controls how fast the
display changes.  Set this to the default to use the value calculated
from your CPU speed ( this value is shown by running EXPLOSIV ?  at
the command line ).  The object number of the display indicates one of
several things; for example, it can be the density of the fractal
pattern, the number or type of objects that appear or may have no
meaning at all.  The meaning varies according to which display you are
using. 



Chapter 5)        CONFIGURATION OPTIONS


Change to the configuration screen by pressing the Alt-C keys.  The
fields that you will see control specific aspects, such as monitor
type and the hot keys of Explosiv when it becomes resident.  Changing
these options may not change the operation of the screen saver until
the next time you install Explosiv. 


  Customizing Memory Usage

The Display Memory Size controls how much memory is allocated to run
Explosiv displays.  Explosiv has the ability to load new displays
directly into the resident program itself.  You do not need to first
remove Explosiv and install it again with the new settings!  Simply
set the display size to a value large enough to load the desired
display and run Explosiv.  You can then change to a new display simply
by running the command

 C:\> EXPLOSIV  NEW <DISPLAY>

or by using the Explosiv interface.  Note that if you are not going to
use this feature then set the display memory size to MIN. This will
force Explosiv to allocate just enough memory to store the display. 

The Memory Usage determines how much memory Explosiv should allocate
for saving the screen state. See the following table:

	VALUE		MEMORY	50 LINE MODE	USER DEFINED FONTS 
	Small		4K	no		no 
	Medium A	8K	yes		no
	Medium		8K	yes		yes, if 25 line mode
	Medium B	8K	no		yes
	Large		12K	yes		yes


  Forcing The Monitor Type

By default Explosiv will automatically select the appropriate monitor
type to use.  You can use the Monitor field to force Explosiv to run
displays for another video card.  For example, set the field to VGA to
force a VGA screen saver ( but note that you should only do this if
you are sure Explosiv picks the wrong monitor type ). 


  Avoiding Conflicts

The Multiplex field indicates the number Explosiv should use to
communicate with resident copies of the screen saver.  Do not change
this value unless Explosiv conflicts with another memory resident
program.  Similarly, the Start and Stop keys indicate the hot keys
that Explosiv should use.  By default Explosiv sets these to
Ctrl-Alt-B and Ctrl-Alt-E, respectively. These fields, which should
not be changed unless a conflict occurs, allow the users to alter the
letters used for the Explosiv hot keys. 


  Disabling Video Checking

If you have a memory resident clock ( or other video activities ) then
Explosiv will not start if Video Checking is on.  By turning this off
Explosiv should start properly regardless of clocks or other screen
changes. 



Chapter 6)        DISPLAY LIBRARIAN


The Displays Librarian allows the user to control which displays are
available to Explosiv.  This information is stored in EXPLOSIV.OVL and
since this file will be changed whenever you use the Librarian it is
important to backup the distributed EXPLOSIV.OVL before using any of
the features described in this section. 


  How Are Displays Accessed

The Explosiv displays are stored in a compressed format in the file
EXPLOSIV.OVL.  Each original display is put into this library once for
each monitor type it supports.  For example, the display Aranea will
have a separate entry for VGA and one for EGA, etc.  If you wish to
save space and allow more room for your own displays ( Explosiv can
store a maximum of 250 displays in the library ) then it is suggested
that you remove all displays for other monitors.  For example, if you
have a VGA monitor then you may remove all entries for EGA, CGA, HERC
and MDA cards. 


  Adding New Displays

To add a new display simply click on the Add button.  A dialog box
will appear asking you for a description of the display and a
filename.  The description is the name of the display that will appear
in the DISPLAYS window, this must be a unique name for your monitor
and be less than 12 characters long.  The filename is the path name of
the program that you wish to archive.  This function will only work
for programs that satisfy the necessary format, for example, Image
Maker programs work fine. 


  Changing A Display

If you wish to change the name of the selected display then click on
the Change button.  A dialog box will appear with the description and
filename of the display you wish to change.  Remember that the
description must be unique for that monitor and if the filename is not
given then DISPLAY.COM is used by default. 


  Dumping A Display

Since the Explosiv library stores displays in compressed format in the
file EXPLOSIV.OVL it is possible to uncompress these displays and
write them to disk. The Dump button will write the display into the
current directory using the name given when the program was first
added. The dumped program will be completely independent of Explosiv
and can be used by WIM.EXE or with screen capturing software to save
patterns to image files. 


  Disabling A Display

Clicking the On/Off button will disable a display.  The display will
remain intact in the Explosiv library but can no longer be run by the
screen saver. Use this feature to disable displays you do not like but
do not want to remove permanently.  To erase a display permanently use
the Remove button. These modules will be permanently erased from the
library.  Removing unwanted displays has the advantage of making the
file EXPLOSIV.OVL smaller and making more entries available for new
modules ( up to a maximum of 250 ). 



Chapter 7)        IMAGE MAKER


Image Maker will allow the user to view GIF images and create programs
from them. These programs can be stand alone or can be incorporated
directly into the Explosiv library.  When you first start the Image
Maker screen a message box will appear telling you that Image Maker is
reading the current directory for files.  The program will only allow
you to see the GIF files and .COM files that are in the directory.  To
read another directory select the item in the DIRS window, a new
message box will appear telling you that Image Maker is searching the
new directory.  Similarly, to read a new drive select the drive from
the DISK window. 


  Selecting The Image Size

Image Maker allows you to select the video mode that the selected
image will be drawn in.  The possible options are listed in the MODES
window, where the desired mode will appear with a mark beside it.  If
the mark is an X, which is the default, Image Maker will allow you to
crop as much of the image as possible.  If the mark is a check, which
can be set by pressing the right or left key within the MODES window,
then the cropped images will be smaller.  The Explosiv library will
only archive files that are smaller than 34K, while Image Maker can
produce much larger programs. Only by setting the check mark can you
be sure that the image you are capturing will be small enough to be
made into a screen saver. The Add button is equivalent in function to
the Add feature described for the Display Librarian. 


  Viewing An Image

To view the file that you have selected simply press ENTER from within
the FILES window.  If the file is a .COM file then the program will be
run, while if the file is a GIF image then the image will be drawn.
Once the image is drawn a box will appear ( this box may be difficult
to see ).  You can move the box around the screen by with the cursor
keys. If you hold the Control key down then the cursor keys will
change the size of the box.  Press ESC at any time to abort. If the
Ctrl-Arrows keys do not work on your machine you may use the Home,
End, PgUp, and PgDn keys instead. 


  Scrolling Around An Image

If the image is larger than the screen then press the TAB key to go
into scroll mode.  The box will disappear and the cursor keys can be
used to reposition the image.  Hold the Control key down at the same
time to move the image around in smaller increments.  Press TAB again
to exit scrolling. The box, which will appear again, can be positioned
as described above. 


  Saving The Image

Once you are done press the ENTER key to save your image or the ESC
key to abort. If you press ENTER then the entire image within the box
will be saved to a file with the same name as the image but with a
.COM extension.  The Image Maker interface will reappear with the new
entry added and the cursor positioned on it, you may then press ENTER
to view the program that you have created.  Saving the image to disk
may take a little longer if the background color is not black. In this
case, Image Maker will beep twice to tell you to be patient while the
color palette is being adjusted. 


  Fixing Jerky Motion

A program that was created for an EGA video mode may appear with jerky
motion on some VGA monitors.  In this case, you will have to set the
object level to 1 to view the image properly.  You cannot do this from
the Image Maker screen but if you exit Explosiv then you can run the
new program with the e1 command line option. To slow down a 256 color
image's movement use the e5 command line option. 




		PART 3        EXPLOSIV FOR WINDOWS



Chapter 8)        USING EXPLOSIV FOR WINDOWS


  Running Explosiv

To start the Windows version of Explosiv, you must first do one of the
following:

 1. Set Explosiv for Windows to be run automatically when Windows starts.
 2. Run Explosiv manually each time Windows is executed.

To invoke Explosiv for Windows double click on the Explosiv icon
within the Explosiv group in the Windows Program Manager.  To access
Explosiv's configuration menus double click on the Explosiv icon name
that appears at the bottom of the Windows Desktop and select Explosiv
Setup. 


  Explosiv Menu Commands

Once started, you can set, modify, and view all parameters through the
Explosiv icon dialog boxes. There are four important menu choices to
be made after clicking on the Explosiv Icon:

    Explosiv Setup	This leads to a group of three dialog boxes;
			the Main box ( displayed after clicking on the
			icon menu choice ), the Display Options box
			( displayed after clicking on the Options...
			button in the Main dialog box ),  and the
			Password box ( displayed after clicking on the
			Password... button ).

    Start Explosiv	Starts Explosiv immediately.

    Registration Info	Information on registering copies of Explosiv.

    About Explosiv	This displays a simple window that refers to the
			release date of the program.



Chapter 9)        SETUP DIALOG BOX


  Changing Screen Saver Attributes

The Setup dialog box controls are very similar in functionality to
those in the DOS version of Explosiv. To begin with, the Select
Display box contains a scrollable list of display choices. Clicking
the mouse on a choice makes that choice the active display. 

The Select Time box contains a scrollable list of times, ranging from
1 to 30 minutes.  Clicking on a value causes that time to be the time
until activation for the screen saver. 

The Screen Saver On box indicates whether or not Explosiv will come on
as a screen saver at the activation time. Clicking on this box toggles
the screen saver On and Off. 

The Demo button lets you preview any of the selected displays. This
button should be clicked on SLOWLY to avoid immediate deactivation. 

NOTE that double clicking the mouse on the Multipak display opens the
Multi Display dialog box where you can add or delete displays.  You
can make the display choices run in the order you have selected or
randomly. Finally, you can select the interval that you want the
displays to change ( the value selected is the number of minutes
before the display will change, ranging from 1 to 60 minutes ).
Selecting 0 means that the display will only change when Explosiv is
activated. 


  Display Options Dialog Box

Display Options ( activated via the Options... button ) contains two
Mouse Corner groups. Clicking on any one corner will make the
corresponding point on the screen either :

	- The corner in which the screen saver is INSTANTLY activated.

	- The corner in which the screen saver will NEVER come on, even
	  at the activation time.

The Display Preferences section of the window contains two scrollable
boxes that set:

	Delay rate	If you find a particular display too fast or slow
			change the delay rate to a value between 0 to 3.

	Object number	This is not defined for all displays, but the
			displays that do use this control will alter the
			type or number of displayed objects as the number
			value selected changes ( with values ranging
			from 1 to 9 ).

For many of the displays selecting a value greater than 6 will give
you a randomly varying display.  This is especially prominent in the
Gyro display. 


  Settings To Prevent Conflicts

Toggling the Detect Mouse Movement box On or Off ( by clicking on it
with the Mouse ) either enables or disables the screen saver's
monitoring of mouse movement. This is especially useful for certain
situations, such as laptop computing. Also, some graphics co-processor
boards work better when the Mouse Movement Detection is turned off. 

The Auto - Off Print Manager box disables Explosiv if the Windows
Print Manager is running. This is especially effective if spooling is
turned on in the Print Manager. 



Chapter 10)        PASSWORD PROTECTION


The Password dialog box is opened by clicking on the Password...
button. To enter a new password, type in your new password in the
Enter Password box, then repeat it in the Confirm Password box. Click
on the Accept button to permanently set your new password. If you have
made a mistake in either your original or confirmation entries, a
failure sign will show up when you press the Accept button. Just start
all over again or erase the WX.INI file to remove all configuration
information. If your password was successfully entered a success
message will be displayed. 

NOTE that passwords can be up to 8 characters in length, and can be
any combination of ASCII characters, including numbers and symbols.
Also, upper and lower case of the same letter are seen as two
different values to the password algorithm. 


  Change A Password

To change a password, first enter your old password in the Old
Password box, and then proceed as outlined above for setting a new
password. If any error is made ( i.e., the Accept button indicates a
Failure ), just start the entire process over again or erase the
WX.INI to clear all the configuration information. 


  Using Password Protection

After you have successfully entered ( or changed ) a password, the
Password On button will be enabled. If this button is selected, then a
Password box will pop up and ask you for your password every time you
try to stop an active display.  Enter your password and then click on
the Accept button or click on the Cancel button to immediately start
the screen saver display again. If you do nothing, the Password Prompt
box will disappear after 8 seconds and the screen saver display will
resume activity. 



Chapter 11)        WINDOWS EXPLOSIV LOGO


Explosiv Logo for Windows is a separate screen saver package that
works in conjunction with Explosiv.  You can toggle between Explosiv
and Explosiv Logo simply by clicking on the Explosiv or Explosiv Logo"
button that appears in the dialog box.  This will stop the current
screen saver and start the other program. 


  Turning DOS Programs Into Screen Savers

Using Explosiv Logo you can turn any DOS program into a screen saver,
simply create a .bat file in the same directory as Explosiv Logo that
runs the program and select the .bat file from Explosiv Logo s list
box.

Chapter 12)        RUNNING EXPLOSIV ON A NETWORK


Explosiv is compatible with most PC networks, the screen saver does
interrupt any other program that is running so it is important that you
do not install Explosiv on the network server ( run Explosiv on the
network clients instead ). 

Explosiv does experience conflicts with certain networks, most
notably, with Novell Lite.  If you find that Explosiv does have a
conflict with your network then you may not be able to run an Explosiv
display without losing the network connection.  The blank display will
still work since this does not interrupt the computer s operation, it
simply turns off the monitor and lets any background process continue. 



Chapter 13)        COMMAND LINE ARGUMENTS


This chapter discusses the entire list of options supported by version
3 of the Explosiv screen saver.  The interface was designed so that
you will never have to know or use the majority of these options.
However, they are all listed here for reference.  The options that are
most useful to know are:

	Explosiv	- run the interface
	Explosiv -	- read the configuration file
	Explosiv on	- activate ( normal, herc=text )
	Explosiv +on	- activate (animate only, herc=graphics 0)
	Explosiv -on	- activate (blank only, herc=graphics 1)
	Explosiv off	- deactivate
	Explosiv remove	- remove the tsr

all the other options can be and should be controlled by the interface.
A complete list of options is listed below:

	blank	This is the only display that does not halt the
		underlying program when it is resident.  The delay
		factor and object variables have no meaning.  No mouse
		support is given to this display if it is resident and
		if blank is resident then no other display can be
		loaded unless you first remove Explosiv.

	random	Select a random display from the Explosiv library.  If
		a display is not found in EXPLOSIV.OVL then a blanking
		display is used   If no display name is specified on the
		command line then random is used.

	<display>  Select the module associated with the display name.
		For example, if Aranea is available in the Explosiv
		library then it can be run simply by typing the command
		EXPLOSIV ARANEA .

	new	Force Explosiv to load the specified configuration into
		the memory resident Explosiv.  Use this parameters to
		change characteristics such as minutes, objects and
		display without first removing Explosiv from memory. 

	on	This option will turn the screen saver on.  If the
		monitor is Hercules then this also tells the screen
		saver to restore the screen to text mode.  If the
		monitor is not Hercules then this tells the screen saver
		to use the animation when possible and to blank the
		screen when it feels that the screen cannot be saved
		properly ( for example, in graphics modes ). 

	+on	This option will turn the screen saver on.  If the
		monitor is Hercules then this also tells the screen
		saver to restore the screen to graphics mode ( page 0 ).
		If the monitor is not Hercules then this tells the
		screen saver to use the animation when possible and not
		to activate when it feels that the screen cannot be
		saved properly ( for example, in graphics modes ).

	-on	This option will turn the screen saver on.  If the
		monitor is Hercules then this also tells the screen saver
		to restore the screen to graphics mode ( page 1 ). If the
		monitor is not Hercules then this tells the screen saver
		to blank the screen under all possible circumstances.

	off	This option will turn the screen saver off.

	+video	This option tells the screen saver that it should check
		for BIOS screen updates.  Any character that is written
		to the screen will reset the screen saver s timer.

	-video	This option tells the screen saver that it should not
		check for BIOS screen updates.  Any character that is
		written to the screen will not reset the screen saver's
		timer.  This option should be used if you are using some
		sort of RAM resident clock.

	mono	This option specifies that the display should be in
		monochrome. 

	color	This option specifies that the display should be in color.

	tinge	This option specifies that the display should be in color.
		This is used to give alternate color patterns to displays
		like Fireworks, Aranea and Serinde.

	d<n>	This option specifies the delay factor that should be
		used.  Here <n> is a number from 1 to 255.  By default,
		Explosiv will check your CPU and generally deduce the
		proper delay factor.  This option should only be used if
		you find the default unreasonable. Run the command
		Explosiv ? to find the default delay for your CPU.

	m<n>	This option must be used if Explosiv is to become a screen
		saver.  Here <n> ranges from 1 to 30 and refers to how
		many minutes of inactivity Explosiv should wait before
		activating.

	e<n>	This option specifies the object level.  This value ranges
		from 1 to 9 ( the default is 4 ).  Not all displays use
		this option and those that do do not always use it in the
		same way. 

	?	This option will display the help screen.  This gives you
		information such as hot keys, Explosiv's working
		directory, monitor type, delay factor, multiplex number
		and some simple command line options.

	-	This option specifies to read the configuration file.  The
		screen saver will also parse the command line but using
		this option will guarantee that the program will become
		memory resident.

	remove	This option tells Explosiv to remove the resident copy of
		the screen saver from memory.  If this is not possible
		because other TSRs are loaded above Explosiv then a
		message will be printed and the screen saver will remain
		active and resident.

	vga	This option specifies that you wish to override the
		Explosiv auto-detection and assume you are using a vga
		monitor.

	ega	This option specifies that you wish to override the
		Explosiv auto-detection and assume you are using an ega
		monitor.

	mcga	This option specifies that you wish to override the
		Explosiv auto-detection and assume you are using a mcga
		monitor.  This option is functionally equivalent to cga. 

	cga	This option specifies that you wish to override the
		Explosiv auto-detection and assume you are using a cga
		monitor.  This option is functionally equivalent to mcga. 

	herc	This option specifies that you wish to override the
		Explosiv auto-detection and assume that you are using a
		Hercules monitor.

	mda	This option specifies that you wish to override the
		Explosiv auto-detection and assume that you are using an
		mda monitor. 

	default	This option sets the screen saver to the default delay
		factor.  Use this to reset a resident copy of the screen
		saver to the default setting ( to do this you must also
		use the New option ).

	mem1	This option tells Explosiv to allocate 4K of memory to
		save the text buffer.  This is the only valid option
		unless you have an EGA or VGA monitor.  Explosiv will
		not be able to restore 43 or 50 line mode if you use
		this option.

	mem2	This option is valid for EGA or VGA monitors only.
		Explosiv will allocate 8K of memory to save the text
		buffer.  This will save 43 or 50 line mode but will not
		restore user defined fonts.  This is the default for EGA.

	mem3	This option is valid for VGA monitors only.  Explosiv will
		allocate 8K of memory to save the text buffer or font
		table.  If you are using 50 line mode then the full text
		buffer will be restored but user defined fonts will not.
		If you are running in 25 line mode then user defined
		fonts will be restored. This is the default value for VGA.

	mem4	This option is valid for VGA monitors only.  Explosiv will
		allocate 8K of memory to save the text buffer or font
		table.  User defined fonts will be restored but 50 line
		mode will not.

	mem5	This option is valid for a VGA monitor only. Explosiv will
		allocate 12K of memory to save the text buffer and font
		table.  User defined fonts will be restored as well as 
		50 line mode.



Chapter 14)        TROUBLE SHOOTING


Some special things to be aware of include:


  DOS Graphics Mode

When a DOS program is running in graphics mode, Explosiv for DOS will
NOT display the currently selected module, but rather will simply
blank the screen. This ensures the best possible restoration of any
screen state ( this blanking may occur even in text mode if Explosiv
cannot reliably determine the systems state ).


  Windows 3.0 Real Mode

Explosiv for Windows does NOT work in Real Mode ( with or without
expanded memory ) in Windows 3.0. It can only be used in Standard or
Enhanced Modes. If you try to start Explosiv for Windows in Real Mode,
Explosiv will simply terminate itself with a explanatory message.
Explosiv for DOS will NOT ACTIVATE when Windows 3.0 is running unless
Windows is running in Real Mode. To disable this ( as it could produce
undesirable side effects ), enter the line "EXPLOSIV OFF" before you
start up Windows in Real Mode ( i.e., win /r ), and then enter
"EXPLOSIV ON" after exiting the Windows Real Mode session. This could
easily be made into a batch file. 


  File Transfers And Printing Under Windows

If you are doing large file transfers over a serial communication line
in Windows, it is advised that you use one of the following displays
in Explosiv:

	CLOCK, STARS, BLAZON, BLANK

These displays will not impede your file transfers to any noticeable
degree. The other displays may slow or even completely stop the
transfers.  The same holds true for printing jobs, with the exception
that if you do all your printing through the Print Manager spooler
then you can then select the Options window and enable the Auto - Off
for Print Manger button. If the Print Manager starts ( even if it starts
on a time delayed command ), Explosiv turns off until all the printing
is finished. 


  Hercules Display

If you are using a Hercules monochrome display and are you unsure as
to whether or not your program is in graphics mode, set Explosiv off
before starting the program to give maximum compatibility with the
underlying program ( alternatively, you can try the +on and -on
option ). 


  Hot Keys

Explosiv for DOS has certain Hot Key assignments that are very
important. They are:

	Ctrl-Alt-Shift	This key combination starts Explosiv
			immediately

	Ctrl-Alt-E	This key combination temporarily disables
			Explosiv

	Ctrl-Alt-B	This key combination enables Explosiv after
			it had been disabled.

These hotkeys may be changed in the configuration screen of the
Explosiv interface. 


  Problems With High Memory

If you have problems installing Explosiv in high memory then you may
need to reconfigure EMM386.EXE so that you use the NOEMS switch rather
than RAM.  DOS requires that at least 48K of memory is available in
high memory before it will load Explosiv ( Explosiv cannot control
this ), only once it is loaded is Explosiv able to reduce its memory
usage.  The RAM switch may have problems loading large programs into
high memory. 


  Key Presses Are Unable To Stop A Display

If a display cannot be disabled by pressing a key try clicking on a
mouse button.  There are a few programs that grab the keyboard in such
a way that Explosiv cannot sense key presses, the result is that the
keyboard appears locked when the display is active.  The mouse,
however, cannot be locked in this manner.
