===============================================================================
  Tiny Viewer is a public domain program.  This copy was supplied with 4FILES,
  and was obtained from the shareware distribution of DOSREF by Dave Williams.

  I have found TV to be useful with 4FILES because the display uses all 
  rows on a 25-row screen, and it shows text in whatever text colors are setup 
  in 4FILES.  Buerg's LIST or the 4DOS internal LIST command may be more to 
  your liking however, since they have a "find" feature, which TV lacks.  

  Neither of the LISTs will display with a dark grey background, which is what
  I like; TV handles it fine.  One thing you may miss in TV is an indication of
  what line you are on (but hey, it's free!).  Since the browser is the first
  item on the 4FILES configuration menu and since 4FILES no longer needs a full
  filespec for utility ports (it now searches the PATH), switching between LIST 
  and TV.COM takes only moments, and you may use the change session-only if you
  wish.

  TV will operate only in 80x25 video text modes.

    Welcome to TinyView (called TV from here on)!  This program is the best
    text file viewer your ever going to see.  It's tiny (958 bytes), it can
    view ANY size text file,  it displays lines up to 1024 characters wide,
    and it uses all 25 lines of your display.   How does TV do all of this?
    Through the magic of assembler.   This  program is written in 100% pure
    assembly language for the smallest, fastest program possible.  When you
    want to view a file you type:

    TV filename.ext  (Paths and drive letters are fully supported)

   ³ HOW TO USE TV ³
   ÀÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÙ
    After  TV  loads  your file you will be presented with a FULL screen of
    data WITHOUT any kind of status  line to clutter up your display.   How
    do you go up and down through the file you ask?   You use the keys that
    would make the most sense, of course!  The keys that TV uses are:

    PgUp - Go up 1 page
    PgDn - Go down 1 page
    Home - Go to the top of the file
    End  - Go to the end of the file
        - Move up one line
        - Move down one line
    ->   - Move screen right 10 columns
    <-   - Move screen back to left margin
    ESC  - Quit TV and exit to DOS

   ³ HIDDEN GOODIES ³
   ÀÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÙ
    Just because TV is small doesn't mean it's not potent.   (Have  any  of
    you  ladies  heard  a  guy say that lately?).   TV filters and properly
    displays ALL 256 characters from the IBM character set.   Who cares you
    say?   You would if TV  didn't  do  that.    You  see,  some of the IBM
    character set can produce "strange"  results  if  your  viewer  doesn't
    properly  handle  the character.   Try using TV on a file that contains
    the ASCII character number 9 (TAB), 10 (line feed), or a 12 (form feed)
    and see what happens.   Now, use your file viewer and see what happens.
    That's when you'll really appreciate the "hidden goodies" of TV!

   ³ FINAL NOTES ³
   ÀÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÙ
    One final note:  TV is to be considered a Public Domain program.   What
    does  that  mean?    It  means that you can freely give this program to
    anyone who wants a copy.   As a  matter of fact I encourage you to give
    this program to everyone, whether or not they want it (grin)!  The only
    stipulation to this offer is this:  you must include  the  file  TV.DOC
    with evey copy of TV.COM that you give away.  Not too tough, huh?
