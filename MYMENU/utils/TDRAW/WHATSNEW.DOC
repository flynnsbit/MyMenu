TheDraw 4.63
============
Maintenance release.  A glitch which came and went... came back.  Blinking
colors in Ansi files would not be properly output if 1) they were the first
colors used and 2) not on the first line.  Special thanks to William Zakreski
for reporting this.  TDFonts would exit with the cursor turned off in some
situations; this should be fixed now.  Thanks to Brian Morin for writing in.

Avatar, PCBoard, and Wildcat formats can now optionally reset the display
color to light gray on the end of files.  The reset is enabled by default,
and corresponds to how Ansi files are handled.  To turn off the color reset,
choose Setup from the Options pulldown menu, go to page 2, and change the
"Reset colors..." toggle.  Thank Alan Shoemaker for recommending this one.

TheDraw now handles @CLS@ Wildcat/PCBoard commands properly.  In an attempt
to filter the @CLS@ command TheDraw adds itself, all were removed.  Lastly,
Wildcat/PCBoard slowdown codes are usable now.

  Remember, do not assume someone else will report a bug you find!
  Please write TheSoft or call G.A.D.M. at (510) 581-3019 if you ever
  find something wrong.  Thanks!


TheDraw 4.62
============
Maintenance release.  Bugs with PCBoard/Wildcat files related to background
colors, scrolling (ie: color wrap-around), and output slow down fixed.  Also
repaired minor glitch in ALT-A screen when Numlock was turned on - the arrow
keys would only increment colors.  Ansi files now include a special sequence
which turns on line wrap-around on terminal programs.  This should help with
headaches related to the display of characters in the 80th column.

Wildcat/PCBoard Sysops:  Because no cursor control is available in these
formats, display output cannot be accurately controlled.  TheDraw assumes
line wrap-around is turned on (the standard Ansi configuration).  If a caller
happens to have line wrap-around turned off, placing characters in column
80 will corrupt the following lines.  There are two solutions:  either do
not place characters in column 80, or display a short Ansi file when your
user first logs turning on line wrapping.  All TheDraw v4.62 Ansi files now
include the appropriate Ansi sequence (ie: save a blank screen).

  Special thanks to Luke Rice for reporting how typing an 'A' in the
    color setup (ALT-A) screen might cause a crash.


TheDraw 4.61
============
A few minor problems have turned up, which are taken care of in this
maintenance release.  A bug in PRINTDOC prevented two sided printing,
THEGRAB did not properly handle some interrupts, the Setup utility had a
couple of hiccups, and TheDraw glitched the foreground color in creating
Ansi files with a space in the upper-left corner.  Special thanks to:

  Anthony Haxton for reporting the Setup utility would sometimes not
    recognize the registered version of TheDraw.
  Paul Hirsch for pointing out in the defaults configuration area of the
    Setup utility one prompt worked backwards (ie: type Yes, and get No).


TheDraw 4.60
============
The following new features were added for version 4.60:

 o    The Quick Palette.   This allows you to choose any color and extended
      character symbol quickly an easily.  It is available when the pulldown
      menus are displayed (press ESC or the right mouse button).  Choosing a
      symbol from the Quick Palette selects the associated function key set.

 o    Manual character painting.  You can "pick-up" any symbol, and draw
      by using SHIFT-Arrow keys.  To pick-up a character, press the ALT-/ key
      combination.  Any symbol selected via the Quick Palette becomes the
      current picked character.

 o    A memory resident screen capture utility is now included, called THEGRAB.
      TheGrab can capture any text mode screen and create TheDraw format files,
      Dos COM files, Ansi files, or Ascii files directly.  It is small, needing
      only 12k of memory.

 o    A new 80 character by 100 line edit buffer option (static screens only).
      Ever have the need to create an extremely long scrolling color Ansi file?
      Now you can do it entirely within TheDraw!  The fact the screen -will-
      scroll is incompatible with animated images.

 o    MULTI-COLOR FONTS!  The previous release could only use single color
      fonts when entering.  This version permits you to use and create font
      symbols drawn with multiple colors.  In fact, you could create a "font"
      of small block graphics if desired now.  Color fonts show a "C" postfix
      in the Fonts pulldown menu.

 o    Animation Fade Out.   Ever wish you have an image appear, and then
      disappear using the same effect?  Previously is was an awkward thing
      to do, forcing you to use sprite mode, solid spaces, a little futzing.
      This option works identically to a Fill, but in addition prompts for
      an animation scanner type.  Neat stuff!

 o    Animation auto-repeat display.  Typing "A" from the ALT-Q Redraw prompt
      will make TheDraw redraw an animation sequence over and over until
      you hit a key.  Useful if your animation has a difficult to find hiccup.

 o    Ability to view TheDraw format files.  You see what would be present
      if you loaded the TD file.

 o    Library files.  Do you maintain both TD and Ansi files for all your
      screen images?  Now you can put all the TD files into one place, and
      attach a descriptive comment also.  The library directory shows the
      description, screen dimensions, and whether the entry is static,
      animated, or a block save.

 o    TheDraw format file compression.  TD files are now compressed when
      saved to greatly reduce disk space requirements.  This applies to
      Library file entries also.

 o    C code file format revised to be compatible with more compilers.

 o    Three new file formats for BBS system operators:  Avatar, PCBoard and
      Wildcat BBS compatible formats can now be loaded/saved with TheDraw.
      Avatar files can be animated.  PCBoard/Wildcat "@-code" files are
      limited to static only screens currently.

 o    To go along with the PCBoard and Wildcat formats, a quick reference
      table of all @-codes is provided.  From normal (non-animated) mode,
      type ALT-Q (note that in animation mode, ALT-Q works as always).

 o    A screen auto-compress option was added to the Setup screen.  Do you
      block marking screens to avoid unused lines being output on the bottom
      of the display?  TheDraw can now optionally remove those unused lines in
      Ansi, Ascii, Avatar, PCBoard, Wildcat static formats automatically.

 o    PRINTDOC now supports HP laserjet printers.

 o    TheDraw checks for the presence of Quarterdeck's Desqview (tm) operating
      environment.  If found, screen initialization is skipped to avoid making
      Desqview always switch on EGA/VGA screen modes.

 o    For registered users, the SHADING.TD screen is now built right in!
      Type ALT-A twice, or select from the pulldown menu.   This shows all
      available color shading combinations possible using dither characters
      from function key set 6.


 Plus several other minor enhancements throughout the program!


 Bug Fixes
 =========

 - Text centering in Animation mode could possibly lockup TheDraw if blank
   lines were present.  This has been fixed.

 - Viewing object files no longer corrupts screen data.

 - Column Insert/Delete should no longer insert extraneous characters, if
   the numeric keypad arrows are used.

 - Loading an Ansi file into a 23 line buffer might have resulted in the
   bottom line being lost.  This no longer occurs.

 - Problems with Ansi Include Files not being copied properly was fixed.

 - Ansi Loader much less likely to spuriously turn on animation mode when
   it is not called for.

 - Improved handling of "color bleeding" which occurs when scrolling Ansi
   files write characters to the lower-right corner of the screen.

 - Fixed problem with loading block files from the command line.  Occasionally
   random garbage would appear surrounding the wanted data.

 - A number of minor fixes and cosmetic improvements to TDFonts.   A rare bug
   with creating the "~" symbol has been fixed.  It could partly damage the
   symbol data.

 - QuickBasic calls to functions UNCRUNCH, ASCIIDISPLAY, and NORMALDISPLAY
   could leave parameters on the stack.  Recompile your code with the new
   functions included here.

 - Block COM files might have received invalid screen offsets if the
   worksheet was scrolled at all.

 - Global Screen Move now works properly when scrolled down into a large
   worksheet.

 - When saving an animated Ansi file, the cursor is no longer forced to the
   left most column.  The last character output in the Animation sequence is
   where the cursor will be left.

 - You could "click" on status line options, even the status line was not
   there (ie: full screen mode).  Now you can't.

 - SETUP utility keyboard configuration now ignores Shift key codes, this
   to handle some keyboards which send such codes before cursor control keys.

Plus several other minor fixes.
