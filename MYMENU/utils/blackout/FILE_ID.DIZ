Give DOS a startup screen like Win95/98
Prevents drivers in CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT
from being able to print on the screen and
optionally loading a RAW graphic image in its
place (similar to the Win95/98 startup screen
when you turn on a computer with Win95/98)
There is a GIF to RAW utility so you can use
any GIF image once it is 320x200 by 256
colours. Although the included graphic is for 
Caldera's DOS, it should work fine for 
MSDOS and PCDOS.
Freeware with source code included.
