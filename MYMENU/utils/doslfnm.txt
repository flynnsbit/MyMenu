| DOSLFN - A Real-mode driver for Long File Names missed in DOS |
|	   With full Unicode and DBCS support!			|
+---------------------------------------------------------------+

This is a version of DOSLFN that uses MSCDEX for CD-ROM support.
As you've probably noticed, it is a bare-bones package. You will
need an earlier version for complete documentation, as well as
a code page file. An earlier version is also necessary in order
to compile. (When I say earlier, I actually mean 0.40.)

Joliet (how Windows encodes long names) is a separate file system
entirely to ISO. This means it is necessary to "link" a long name
with its corresponding short name, so it can be accessed by MSCDEX.
MKLINK is provided to create the link table, which DOSLFN uses to
perform the linking.

From the 0.32o documentation:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
MKLINK (name may change in future) creates "Joliet Directory Link Tables"
for each Joliet CD found.
By default, it scans all CD drives, and creates this table using a rather
complex, recursive processing. MKLINK chooses file names derivated from
CD's Volume Label, and appends .JLT, for each CD processed.
Therefore one can scan in his CD collection and create tables for all.
These tables will be used by DOSLFN to gain access
to long file names on media not created by WinOnCD.

MKLINK accepts some command line parameters. There are following options:
 /b	* interactive batch processing of a whole CD collection
 /f	* force reading CD even when link table file is already present
	* force reading CD ignoring CeQuadrat WinOnCD Table
 /v	* show reading process in multiple lines (as a table, recommended)
 /v-	* don't show reading process
 /c	* compare order of ISO and Joliet tree
 /h	* show help
Selecting drives is done by typing single drive letter(s).

You should let MKLINK drop its .JLT files to the working directory of DOSLFN,
this is the default when you leave MKLINK beside DOSLFN.
It is not a good idea to burn a .JLT file on its CDROM in a multi-session
because burning another session skews all directory sectors.

This shall probably be the last version of DOSLFN to support MSCDEX (or any
other CD-ROM redirector other than SHSUCDX). SHSUCDX provides much better
access to Joliet, as well as long ISO names. It can be found at:

PS: DOSLFNMM.COM is the equivalent of DOSLFNMS.COM (if you don't know what
    that is, you've not got the earlier version, or it's *too* early).
