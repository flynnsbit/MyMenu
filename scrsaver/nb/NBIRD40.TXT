nbird40.zip     Virtual reality simulation of birds in flight

Night Bird is a 3D animation of white birds flying endlessly over a
forest at night.  Your viewpoint changes periodically as you swing around
the birds in a great arc, or find yourself on the ground watching the
birds flying by overhead.  The Registered Version can display up to 64
birds, includes Password Security, an Editor for changing the 3D text
which displays on the forest floor, and the necessary files for running
the program as a DOS, Windows 3.1 or Windows 95 screen saver.

Special requirements: 386 PC with VGA, or better.

Changes: Multiple Birds, multiple views, increased realism.

nbird40.zip has replaced nbird34.zip.
