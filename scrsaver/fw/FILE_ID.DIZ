Sparkwood is the first true 3D Virtual
Reality simulation of a Fireworks exhibition. 
The fireworks are surprisingly realistic, 
taking into account gravity, inertia and air
resistance. Includes a complete control panel
for changing your viewing position. Watch
from on the ground under the trees, or float
perilously above the fireworks and see them
burst beneath your feet! Requires a 386 PC
with VGA or better. Includes online help and
documentation.
