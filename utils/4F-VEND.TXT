NAMING CONVENTIONS:
-------------------   Archives of 4FILES should be named 4FILE???.xxx (where
xxx is the archive extension), showing all characters in the version number.
The exception is CIS for which names will always be 4FILES.ZIP.  The program is
usually accompanied by a 4FILES.INF info file.

KEYWORDS:
---------
FILE MANAGER DESCRIPTION EDITOR 4DOS NDOS 4FILES NOTES WINDOWS OS/2 DV LAUNCHER
FRONT END

CATEGORY:
---------  4FILES is hard to classify because it fits several categories well.
It could be listed as a file-management utility, 4DOS-support utility or shell
(I prefer one or both of the first two).  Listing 4FILES in more than one of
the above classifications or directories would be much appreciated, and is
credible since the file is small.

LONG DESCRIPTION:
-----------------  4FILES v3.0 is a multi-purpose file management tool which
smoothly integrates 4DOS & NDOS "file notes" and up to seven of your favorite
utilities into the work at hand.  File management operations may be done on
single files or marked groups of files.  File notes provide ready information
to aid in the use or management of files.  4FILES displays them along with the
file name and full file statistics in a sortable directory listing.  Special
attention has been given to providing the most efficient rapid-fire, point-and-
shoot browsing of files possible, as an aid to composing notes about one or a
succession of files.  The built-in note editor is well adapted to its task.

    Special attention has also been given to efficient navigation of drives and
directories, and the method developed may well be the best you have tried.
Besides innovative features to accomplish this, change-directory utilities such
as LCD and ACD are used to their best advantage if available on your system.

    The utility ports and program options may be configured on-the-fly.  Seven
ports are provided, of which some are specialized for file browsing,
several archive functions, and text editing.  Other ports are suitable for a
word processor or any utility or application.  It addition to this utility
support, any program in the directory listing or any data file with a
"executable extension" may be executed directly.  A DOS command line is also
available.


KUDOS:
======

 "Previously I avoided file descriptions w/ 4DOS, a really useful feature.
  Now I love them.  The integration of LIST, FV, EDIT, etc. is excellent.
  Easy to (configure).  Nice utility!"  (San Pedro, Ca)

 "One of my handiest utilities.  I use it every day."  (USAF programmer)

 "From the moment I began to read your very complete and accurate document-
  ation, I was certain this software package was something I would find
  useful and worth supporting.  Pleasingly, I was not disappointed.  Your
  effort is a shining example of that which is worthy.  Please accept not
  only my registration, but my thanks and congratulations for having
  produced such a fine addition to one of my favorite shareware programs
  (4DOS)."  (Marysville, Oh)
