[!] Now the DPMI32 version of DN/2 is available.
[!] [OS/2][DPMI32] Now DN is able to enter network directories
    (cd \\server\share\path), however operating system cannot run
    programs from them (one should try full path: Shift+Ctrl+Enter, 
    Enter).
[!] Added search in panels of Search, Branch and Search in archive, and also 
    search in directories and archives in panels of Search, Branch, etc.
[!] Added ability to search files in selected subdirectories 
    of a current directory, and also among selected files in panels
    of Files, Search, Branch, etc.

[*] Irrelevant hot key Alt+Tab is replaced with Ctrl+Shift+Tab 
    for switching windows.
[-] Strange commands like 'cd \?' gave strange results.
[-] It was impossible to copy symbols with code less than $20 (space)
    from Character Table to input lines.
[*] To enter symbols from Character Table without its closing there's a new
    hot key (Space) added to Ctrl+Enter.
[*] Added hint for Character Table in status bar.
[*] Changed format of system error message. Numerical code moved 
    to window title, and string with message from OS added, 
    if description exists for the code.
[*] [OS2] When pressing Ctrl+F, a folder opened in background of DN window.
    Now it is opened in foreground.
[-] When switching to file in editor (Ctrl+Enter), paths without recursion
    didn't work in search paths setup.
[-] Moving of file (F6) didn't work if source and destination drives
    seemed to the be same, but in fact weren't the same (it is possible
    for network drives and on NDFS under OS/2).
[-] When moving a file (F6) to a write protected directory,
    wrong error message was shown.
[*] [DPMI] Now vertical mouse wheel works with CuteMouse 2.x driver.
[*] Removed unnecessary delivery of time slice in main waiting cycle.
    It could lead to delays, especially under Win9x.

    descriptions containing long lines (more than 255 symbols).
[-] When entering '*', a letter and BackSpace in quick search mask, 
    asteriks was deleted along with a letter.
[-] In many cases directories with unknown size were treated 
    as having size of -1 byte.
[*] Now in editor, when "Overwrite blocks" option is turned on
    and a command to paste from buffer is received, the block nevertheless
    is not overwritten if its content is identical to the content 
    of buffer. This lightens multiple insertion of the same buffer.
[-] Error message when entering specified directory displayed
    error code 21 (drive not ready) regardless of actual error code.
[-] In archives and possibly other non-disk panels sometimes
    random descriptions in footer were shown.
[-] Decreased number of situations when single Alt was recognized
    and quick search was called mistakenly (for example, as the result
    of switching layout with Alt+Shift).
[-] In archives made under other OS the name consisting of one point only
    displayed incorrectly.
[-] [DPMI32] DOS session of OS/2 had effect of 100% CPU loading.
[*] Now when pressing F3 file opened in Quick View window 
    is opened in Viewer even with ReuseViewers=2.
[*] Now dn.err is appended instead of being rewritten, and information
    about version of DN is placed there.

    for multiline descriptions. Line feeds and initial spaces 
    are replaces with a single space.
[*] Unified hot keys of sorting dialog and menu.
[*] Added indication of current sorting mode with a letter 
    in top left corner of panel border. Small letter represents normal
    order and capital letter is for reversed order. Clicking mouse button
    on this indicator calls sorting selection menu.
[*] Sorting selection menu now contains "Directories by name" item.
[*] In sorting selection menu selecting item from modes section
    now doesn't result in menu closing.
[-] Double click with right mouse button on clock resulted 
    in hiding panels.
[*] Added bew type of menu item: submenu with default item.
    Such item is labeled with opening arrow in square brackets.
    Default submenu item is executed without opening submenu with Enter
    or mouse click in item's main text. To open submenu one can use 
    Shift+Enter or mouse click within brackets.
    To change default menu item one should open submenu, select needed
    item and press Space.
[*] This technique used in sorting selection menu (Alt+B) and preset menu
    (Alt+-).
[*] Now last set default submenu value in sorting selection menu 
    and preset menu is saved to dn.cfg.
[*] Preset loading type with Ctrl+number in file panel is now similar
    to default value of submenu in preset selection menu.
[*] Now vertical menu open submenu on right arrow and close them 
    on left arrow.
[-] [DPMI32] Not all interrupt vectors restored after executing dn.prg.
[-] [DPMI32] Hot keys Ctrl+number (except for Ctrl+2 and Ctrl+6) 
    didn't work.
[-] In information panel tildes in dirinfo texts were changing text color 
    instead of being displayed.
[*] Added new hot key '2' (the same button as '@') to drive selection menu.
[-] Copying (F5) and moving (F6) a directory to '..' didn't work.
[-] In footer of file selection dialog (Shift+F4) tildes in path 
    were changing text color instead of being displayed.
[-] When entering network directory, a root shared resource was detected
    incorrectly, which resulted in errors, for example, in file creation 
    dialog.
[-] [DPMI32] DN crashed under DOS with DOSLFN loaded when trying to execute
    something through user menu.
[*] Now it is possible not to show file name in line with information
    about current file.
[*] Now at least one space is left between sorting indicator and path
    in right panel.
[*] In dialogs of sorting and panel appearance setup added ability
    to mark separate elements. When marked elements exist, only them
    are saved and recorded.
[-] In line with information about current file in footer file name
    and length merged when 12-hour time format was selected.
[*] Block of long file name format options in footer moved 
    from panel appearance setup dialog to file manager setup.
[*] File panel column titles output options moved from file manager 
    setup dialog to panel appearance setup.
[*] In general setup options of file manager added possibility to turn off
    sorting indicator.
[-] Long file name with tildes was shown incorrectly in footer.
[*] Now large amounts of files, drives, memory are shown uncut (at least 
    up to 10 terabytes).
[-] [Win32] With autorefresh of panels it was impossible to delete 
    a directory while standing on its subdirectory in other panel.
    Good chance that other situations of "undeletable" directory
    are also fixed.
[-] [OS2] After calling some buggy external console programs
    mouse in DN stopped working.
[*] Now DPMI32 version under W9x shows time of file creation 
    and last access.
[-] In DPMI32 version when Win32 LFN API was not accessible, 
    garbage was shown instead of time of file creation and last access;
    not nothing is displayed in this case.
[-] Dialog of search in archive had effect of 100% CPU loading.
[-] Search mask was displayed incorrectly in title of panel
    when searching files within an archive.
[-] In network browser panel now files search is now called in place
    not related to it.
[*] Check boxes in search dialogs are regrouped: now options common 
    for all dialogs come first, and the last are options which set up
    criteria of searching a text line in file.
[*] "Don't sort" option is now available when searching in archive too.
[-] When searching in archive an empty panel was shown if no files
    were found.
[-] In dates of file creation and last access in corresponding panel columns
    year was shown incorrectly.
[*] Lots of messages flashed by when deleting files from Search 
    or Branch panel.
[*] Switching of hidden files display mode now works in Search
    and Branch panels.
[-] Search and Branch panels didn't reflect changes of file attributes
    or time.
[*] Now it is not necessary to restart DN/2 after changing language.
[*] "(D:\PATH)" command line mode for running sessions in a separate 
    window is now accessible not only in OS/2, but in Win32 version too,
    and also in DPMI32 version under Win9x. In DPMI32 version under OS/2
    both "(D:\PATH)" and "[D:\PATH]" modes are available, however
    HSTART utility presence is required for them to work.
[-] Hot keys of changing command line type (Alt+/ and Alt+Shift+/) 
    didn't work under Win32.
[*] Essentially optimized re-reading of panels in some situations.
[*] Added two palette elements for a long file name in panel footer.
[-] When scrolling long file names in panel with arrows (when width
    of name column is more than width of a panel) and also when scrolling
    descriptions, paths, etc. footer was scrolling along with them.
[-] Built-in default palettes have been corrected to comply
    with the latest changes in palette elements.
[-] When setting up colors with "B/W" or "Mono" modes active,
    changes were mistakenly saved in pallette of "Color" mode.
[-] In Colors Setup dialog garbage was displayed in preview box
    if foreground and background colors were set to black.
[-] Now extracting files from archives works in DPMI32 version.
[*] In DPMI32 version in archivers setup added option
    "Swap when execute" to set up whether DN/2 should unload itself 
    from memory when calling archiver; "Short command line" option, 
    being unnecessary under DOS, has been eliminated in DPMI32 version.
[*] Archivers not supporting file lists in DPMI32 version 
    now work with "Swap when execute" option turned on too.
[-] Viewing files through a filter worked incorrectly in DPMI32 version.
[*] When switching additional modes of sorting, selection menu
    sometimes changed its width.
[*] Now color of opened combo box complies with color of a closed one.
[*] Drive information with Ctrl+L in DN/DPMI32.
    Sometimes network drives didn't have VolumeLabel, also a garbage 
    could be displayed in this case.
    If there's no information about serial number or file system,
    these lines are not shown at all.
    Cluster size is displayed.
    Disk size and free space is shown correctly for large drives.
[*] Improved detection of LHA and GZip archives.
