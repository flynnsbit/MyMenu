The main differences between 2.12 and 2.11 beta versions.

[-] In file search dialogs' input lines history button covered
    the end of input line.
[-] [Win32] Scrolling of mouse wheel in file panel, editor, etc. 
    resulted in cursor movement instead of window scrolling.
[-] When activating information panel and changing drive in this panel
    (Alt+F1/F2), garbage was shown in panel title, and sometimes
    DN crashed.
[-] Directory description in information panel (dirinfo, etc.) 
    was displayed unpredictably. Usually it wasn't displayed right after
    Ctrl-L and appeared after changing drive on disk panel.
[-] [Win32] Problems with drive changing could occure, 
    if OS returns path with small drive letter in response to query 
    for current directory. For example, if making a shortcut to run DN/2 
    with 'c:\dn-2\dn.exe' path instead of 'C:\dn-2\dn.exe'.
[-] [OS/2] Disk was detected incorrectly for "Drive - Volume label" 
    operation.
[*] Operation "Disk - Volume label" is now ignored if there is a network
    directory in active panel.
[-] Calculator didn't interpret an order with explicit "+" sign,
    for example, 1e+6.
[-] In calculator a result of computation by "Calculate" button
    looked like it was selected, but in fact it wasn't. For example,
    in couldn't be copied to buffer with Ctrl-Ins.
[*] Now in calculator the result of computation by "Calculate" button
    is shown in selected representation form.
[*] Now texts in the result block are displayed in form corresponding
    to one in the input line. For example, line with the result
    in binary form now shows something like "1101b" instead of "1101".
[-] When extracting an input line value from history, the corresponding
    dialog elements were not updated. This was apparent, for instance,
    in calculator (expression was not recalculated) and in text search
    dialogs (HEX string was not updated).
[-] In calculator trigonometric functions were used for ASH ACOSH ACH 
    instead of hyperbolic.
[-] Cosmetic correctings in Russian and Ukraininan help to calculator.
[*] Internal optimizations in calculator.
[-] Sorting indicator was shown regardless of its display option.
[-] If saving desktop with an archive opened in one of panels,
    and then restoring desktop when there is neither archive left nor
    letter of drive which the archived was located on, DN crashed.
[-] When pressing Ctrl+\ in a network directory of non-root level,
    cursor was moved to the beginning of panel instead of being located
    on the root level directory we were in (therefore behaviour
    of Ctrl+\ in a network directory was different from one in
    a directory on local drive).
[-] When showing free space or directory information on divider 
    in file panels, the separator line completely disappeared.
[-] Ctrl-Enter hot key in editor didn't work with full path.
[-] DN crashed in some situations when panels autorefresh was
    turned on. There are two of such situations. First one:
    quickly switching to destination directory after copying
    files from an archive NOT through a temporary directory
    and not hurrying to close the dialog. After some time file cursor
    disappears from panel and from now on deleting leads to crash.
    Second situation: similar actions with the dialog of overwriting
    a file when copying from archive through a temporary directory.
    Demonstration of both situations was noticed in Win32 DN version.
[*] [Win32] Now a base directory path for 'subst' drives is shown 
    in drive menu under NT systems (as for network drives).
[*] DN/2 is now compiled with defines {$DEFINE PrintManager} and
    {$DEFINE Printer}; so, menu items "File => Print" and "Options =>
    Configuration => Printer setup..." now are enabled;
[*] In "Printer Setup" dialog additionally to the standard output devices
    (COM1-COM4, LPT1-LPT4, NUL) and output to file also two user-defined
    output devices could be chosen, i.e. names of shared printers in the
    network
[*] In directories, view and edit history dialogs the new "Stand at" button
    is added. Pressing this button causes directory changing in active file
    panel to the directory containing current history item (file or
    directory) and positioning of file cursor to the current file/directory
[*] The possibility to open password-protected shared directories with
    the Password and User name request was added to the Network browser
[*] Localization of Network error messages;
[-] DN/2 crashed after Network error messages;
[-] The cursor was not positioned on previous shared folder after changing
    from it to shared folders panel of upper level;
[*] While entering shared directory proceeds, "Please stand by..." message
    is shown;
[*] If attempt to enter the Password and User name while opening
    password-protected shared directory is failed then the current directory
    will not be changed in the Network panel, and its content will not be
    reread

[-] TAR archives were read incorrectly.

[-] If setting up autohide for a long file name in footer (Options -
    File Manager - Setup... - If not fully shown anywhere [X]),
    the '..' element was not hidden.
[-] Orthographical edition in Russian panel view dialog.
[-] [Win32, DPMI32] Panel mask was always applied to short file names,
    whereas file search (Alt+F7) always concerned long file names.
    Now in both cases the names which are currently displayed in panel
    are used.
[*] [Win32, DPMI32] Now panel of file search results (Alt+F7) inherits
    short/long names display mode from the panel the search was called in.
[-] [Win32, DPMI32] The flag of short/long names in panel columns was not
    visible in Russian panel view dialog.
[-] If switching off sorting indicator in Manager setup, it appeared again
    after hiding and showing file panel (for example, Ctrl+L, Ctrl+L)
    until changing directory.
